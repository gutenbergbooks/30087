</div><div class='unindent'>HE book is not a novel" is a phrase
often in the mouth of critics, who on
second thoughts might, perhaps, add
with less emphasis, "It does not conform
to the common type of novel." Fortified, however,
with that sense of rectitude that dictates conformity
to our neighbours and a safe acquiescence
in the mysterious movements of public taste, the
critics have exclaimed with touching unanimity&mdash;"What
a pity Jefferies tried to write novels! Why
didn't he stick to essays in natural history!"</div>

<p>What a pity Jefferies should have given us
"Amaryllis at the Fair," and "After London"!&mdash;this
opinion has been propagated with such fervency
that it seems almost a pity to disturb it by inquiring
into the nature of these his achievements. Certainly
the critics, and their critical echoes, are united. "He
wrote some later novels of indifferent merit," says
a critic in "Chambers' Encyclop&aelig;dia." "Has anyone
ever been able to write with free and genuine<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>
appreciation of even the later novels?" asks or
echoes a lady, Miss Grace Toplis, writing on Jefferies.
"In brief, he was an essayist and not a novelist at
all," says Mr. Henry Salt. "It is therefore certain
that his importance for posterity will dwindle, if it
has not already dwindled, to that given by a bundle
of descriptive selections. But these will occupy a
foremost place on their particular shelf, the shelf at
the head of which stands Gilbert White and Gray,"
says Mr. George Saintsbury. "He was a reporter
of genius, and he never got beyond reporting. Mr.
Besant has the vitalising imagination which Jefferies
lacked," says Mr. Henley in his review of Walter
Besant's "Eulogy of Richard Jefferies"; and again,
"They are not novels as he (Walter Besant) admits,
they are a series of pictures.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. That is the way
he takes Jefferies at Jefferies' worst." Yes, it is very
touching this unanimity, and it is therefore a pleasure
for this critic to say that in his <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'judgement'">judgment</ins> "Amaryllis
at the Fair" is one of the very few later-day novels
of English country life that are worth putting on
one's shelf, and that to make room for it he would
turn out certain highly-praised novels by Hardy
which do not ring quite true, novels which the critics
and the public, again with touching unanimity, have
voted to be of high rank. But what is a novel? the
reader may ask. A novel, says the learned Charles
Annandale, is "a fictitious prose narrative, involving
some plot of greater or less intricacy, and professing
to give a picture of real life, generally exhibiting
the passions and sentiments, in a state of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">[ix]</a></span>
great activity, and especially the passion of love."
Well, "Amaryllis at the Fair" is a fictitious prose
narrative professing to give a picture of real life,
and involving a plot of little intricacy. Certainly it
exhibits the passions and sentiments in a state of
great activity. But Mr. Henry Salt, whose little
book on Jefferies is the best yet published, further
remarks: "Jefferies was quite unable to give any
vivid dramatic life to his stories .&nbsp;.&nbsp;. his instinct
was that of the naturalist who observes and moralizes
rather than that of the novelist who penetrates and
interprets; and consequently his rustic characters,
though strongly and clearly drawn, do not live, as,
for example, those of Thomas Hardy live.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Men
and animals are alike mere figures in his landscapes."</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>So far the critics. Jefferies being justly held to
be "no ordinary novelist," it is inferred by most
that something is wrong with "Amaryllis the Fair,"
and the book has been passed over in silence. But we
do not judge every novel by the same test. We do
not judge "Tristram Shandy," for example, by its
intricate plot, or by its "vivid drama," we judge it
simply as an artistic revelation of human life and by
its humorous insight into human character. And
judged by the same simple test "Amaryllis at the
Fair," we contend, is a living picture of life, a
creative work of imagination of a high order. Iden,
the unsuccessful farmer who "built for all time, and
not for the circumstances of the hour," is a masterly
piece of character drawing. But Iden is a personal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
portrait, the reader may object, Well, what about
Uncle Toby? From what void did he spring? Iden,
to our mind, is almost as masterly a conception,
as broadly human a figure as Uncle Toby. And
Mrs. Iden, where will you find this type of nervous,
irritable wife, full of spiteful disillusioned love for
her dilatory husband better painted than by Jefferies?
But Mrs. Iden is a type, not an individual, the
reader may say. Excellent reader! and what about
the Widow Wadman? She is no less and no more
of an individual than is Mrs. Iden. It was a great
feat of Sterne to create so cunningly the atmosphere
of the Shandy household, but Jefferies has accomplished
an artistic feat also in drawing the relations
of the Idens, father, mother, and daughter. How
true, how unerringly true to human nature is this
picture of the Iden household; how delicately felt
and rendered to a hair is his picture of the father's
sluggish, masculine will, pricked ineffectually by the
waspish tongue of feminine criticism. Further, we
not only have the family's idiosyncrasies, their habits,
mental atmosphere, and domestic story brought before
us in a hundred pages, easily and instinctively
by the hand of the artist, but we have the whole book
steeped in the breath of English spring, the restless
ache of spring that thrills through the nerves, and
stirs the sluggish winter blood; we have the spring
feeling breaking from the March heavens and the
March earth in copse, meadow, and ploughland, as it
has scarcely been rendered before by English novelist.
The description of Amaryllis running out into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>
March wind to call her father from his potato planting
to see the daffodil; the picture of Iden pretending
to sleep in his chair that he may watch the mice;
the description of the girl Amaryllis watching the
crowd of plain, ugly men of the countryside flocking
along the road to the fair; the description of Amadis
the invalid, in the old farm kitchen among the stalwart
country folk&mdash;all these pictures and a dozen
others in the book are painted with a masterly hand.
Pictures! the critical reader may complain. Yes,
pictures of living men and women. What does it
matter whether a revelation of human life is conveyed
to us by pictures or by action so long as it is
conveyed? Mr. Saintsbury classes Jefferies with
Gray, presumably because both writers have written
of the English landscape. With Gray! Jefferies in
his work as a naturalist and observer of wild life
may be classed merely for convenience with Gilbert
White. But this classification only applies to one half
of Jefferies' books. By his "Wild Life in a Southern
County" he stands beside Gilbert White; by his
"Story of My Heart" he stands by himself, a little
apart from the poets, and by "Amaryllis at the Fair"
he stands among the half-dozen country writers of
the century whose work is racy of the English soil
and of rural English human nature. We will name
three of these writers, Barnes, Cobbett, Waugh, and
our attentive readers can name the other three.</p>

<p>To come back to "Amaryllis at the Fair," why is
it so masterly, or, further, wherein is it so masterly,
the curious reader may inquire? "Is it not full of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
digressions? Granted that the first half of the 'novel'
is beautiful in style, does not Jefferies suddenly
break his method, introduce his own personality,
intersperse abrupt disquisitions on food, illness, and
Fleet Street? Is not that description of Iden's
dinner a little&mdash;well, a little unusual? In short, is
not the book a disquisition on life from the standpoint
of Jefferies' personal experiences? And if this
is so, how can the book be so fine an achievement?"
Oh, candid reader, with the voice of authority
sounding in your ears (and have we not Mr. Henley
and Mr. Saintsbury bound in critical amity against
us), a book may break the formal rules, and yet it
may yield to us just that salt of life which we may
seek for vainly in the works of more faultless writers.
The strength of "Amaryllis at the Fair" is that its
beauty springs naturally from the prosaic earthly
facts of life it narrates, and that, in the natural
atmosphere breathed by its people, the prose and the
poetry of their life are one. In the respect of the
artistic naturalness of its homely picture, the book
is very superior to, say "The Mayor of Casterbridge,"
where we are conscious that the author has been at
work arranging and rearranging his charming studies
and impressions of the old-world people of Casterbridge
into the pattern of an exciting plot. Now it
is precisely in the artificed dramatic story of "The
Mayor of Casterbridge"&mdash;and we cite this novel as
characteristic, both in its strength and weakness, of
its distinguished author,&mdash;that we are brought to
feel that we have not been shown the characters of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
Casterbridge going their way in life naturally, but
that they have been moved about, kaleidoscopically,
to suit the exigencies of the plot, and that the more
this is so the less significance for us have their
thoughts and actions. Watching the quick whirling
changes of Farfrae and Lucetta, Henchard and
Newson in the matrimonial mazes of the story, and
listening to the chorus of the rustics in the wings, we
perceive indeed whence comes that atmosphere of
stage crisis and stage effect which suddenly introduces
a disillusioning sense of unreality, and mars
the artistic unity of this charming picture, so truthful
in other respects to English rural life. Plot is
Mr. Hardy's weakness, and perfect indeed and convincing
would have been his pictures, if he could
have thrown his plots and his rustic choruses to the
four winds. May we not be thankful, therefore, that
Jefferies was no hand at elaborating a plot, and that
in "Amaryllis at the Fair," the scenes, the descriptions,
the conversations are spontaneous as life, and
that Jefferies' commentary on them is like Fielding's
commentary, a medium by which he lives with his
characters. The author's imagination, memory, and
instinctive perception are, indeed, all working together;
and so his picture of human life in
"Amaryllis" brings with it as convincing and as
fresh a breath of life as we find in Cobbett's,
Waugh's and Barnes' country writings. When a
writer arrives at being perfectly natural in his atmosphere,
his style and his subject seem to become
one. He moves easily and surely. Out of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
splintered mass of ideas and emotions, out of the
sensations, the observations and revelations of his
youth, and the atmosphere familiar to him through
long feeling, he builds up a subtle and cunning
picture for us, a complete illusion of life more true
than the reality. For what prosaic people call the
reality is merely the co-ordination in their own minds
of perhaps a thousandth part of aspects of the life
around them; and only this thousandth part they
have noticed. But the creative mind builds up a
living picture out of the thousands of aspects most
of us are congenitally blind to. This is what Jefferies
has done in "Amaryllis at the Fair." The book is
rich in the contradictory forces of life, in its quick
twists and turns: we feel in it there is nature working
alike in the leaves of grass outside the Idens'
house, in the blustering winds round the walls, and
in the minds of the characters indoors; and the style
has the freshness of the April wind. Everything is
growing, changing, breathing in the book. But the
accomplished critics do not notice these trivial
strengths. It is enough for them that Jefferies was
not a novelist! Indeed, Mr. Saintsbury apparently
thinks that Jefferies made a mistake in drawing his
philosophy from an open-air study of nature, for he
writes: "Unfortunately for Jefferies his philosophic
background was not like Wordsworth's clear and
cheerful, but wholly vague and partly gloomy." It
was neither vague nor gloomy, we may remark,
parenthetically, but we may admit that Jefferies saw
too deeply into nature's workings, and had too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
sensuous a joy in life to interpret all Nature's doings,
&agrave; la Wordsworth, and lend them a portentously
moral significance.</p>

<p>The one charge that may with truth be brought
against "Amaryllis at the Fair" is that its digressions
damage the artistic illusion of the whole. The
book shows the carelessness, the haste, the roughness
of a sketch, a sketch, moreover, which Jefferies
was not destined to carry to the end he had planned,
but we repeat, let us be thankful that its artistic
weaknesses are those of a sketch direct from nature,
rather than those of an ambitious studio picture.
And these digressions are an integral part of the
book's character, just as the face of a man has its
own blemishes: they are one with the spirit of the
whole, and so, if they break somewhat the illusion
of the scenes, they do not damage its spiritual unity.
It is this spiritual unity on which we must insist,
because "Amaryllis" is indeed Jefferies' last and
complete testament on human life. He wrote it, or
rather dictated it to his wife, as he lay in pain,
slowly dying, and he has put into it the frankness of
a dying man. How real, how solid, how deliciously
sweet seemed those simple earthly joys, those human
appetites of healthy, vigorous men to him! how intense
is his passion and spiritual hunger for the
beauty of earth! Like a flame shooting up from the
log it is consuming, so this passion for the green
earth, for the earth in wind and rain and sunshine,
consumes the wasted, consumptive body of the dying
man. The reality, the solidity of the homely farmhouse<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[xvi]</a></span>
life he describes spring from the intensity
with which he clings to all he loves, the cold March
wind buffeting the face, the mating cries of the
birds in the hot spring sunshine. Life is so terribly
strong, so deliciously real, so full of man's unsatisfied
hungry ache for happiness; and sweet is the craving,
bitter the knowledge of the unfulfilment. So, inspiring
and vivifying the whole, in every line of
"Amaryllis" is Jefferies' philosophy of life. Jefferies
"did not understand human nature," say the accomplished
critics. Did he not? "Amaryllis at the Fair"
is one of the truest criticisms of human life, oh
reader, you are likely to meet with. The mixedness
of things, the old, old human muddle, the meanness
and stupidity and shortsightedness of humanity, the
good salty taste of life in the healthy mouth, the
spirituality of love, the strong earthy roots of
appetite, man's lust of life, with circumstances awry,
and the sharp wind blowing alike on the just and
the unjust&mdash;all is there on the printed page of
"Amaryllis at the Fair." The song of the wind and
the roar of London unite and mingle therein for
those who do not bring the exacting eye of superiority
to this most human book.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'>MARYLLIS found the first daffodil
flowering by the damask rose, and
immediately ran to call her father to
come and see it.</div>

<p>There are no damask roses now, like
there used to be in summer at Coombe Oaks. I
have never seen one since I last gathered one from
that very bush. There are many grand roses, but
no fragrance&mdash;the fragrance is gone out of life.
Instinctively as I pass gardens in summer I look
under the shade of the trees for the old roses, but
they are not to be found. The dreary nurseries of
evergreens and laurels&mdash;cemeteries they should be
called, cemeteries in appearance and cemeteries of
taste&mdash;are innocent of such roses. They show
you an acre of what they call roses growing out of
dirty straw, spindly things with a knob on the top,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
which even dew can hardly sweeten. "No call
for damask roses&mdash;wouldn't pay to grow they.
Single they was, I thinks. No good. These be
cut every morning and fetched by the flower-girls
for gents' button-holes and ladies' jackets. You
won't get no damask roses; they be died out."</p>

<p>I think in despite of the nurseryman, or cemetery-keeper,
that with patience I could get a
damask rose even now by inquiring about from
farmhouse to farmhouse. In time some old farmer,
with a good old taste for old roses and pinks,
would send me one; I have half a mind to try.
But, alas! it is no use, I have nowhere to put it;
I rent a house which is built in first-rate modern
style, though small, of course, and there is a
"garden" to it, but no place to put a damask rose.
No place, because it is not "home," and I cannot
plant except round "home." The plot or "patch"
the landlord calls "the garden"&mdash;it is about as
wide as the border round a patch, old style&mdash;is
quite vacant, bare, and contains nothing but mould.
It is nothing to me, and I cannot plant it.</p>

<p>Not only are there no damask roses, but there
is no place for them now-a-days, no "home," only
villas and rented houses. Anything rented in a
town can never be "home."</p>

<p>Farms that were practically taken on a hundred
and twenty, or fifty, or perhaps two hundred years'
leases were "homes." Consequently they had
damask roses, bees, and birds about them.</p>

<p>There had been daffodils in that spot at least a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
century, opening every March to the dry winds
that shrivel up the brown dead leaves of winter,
and carry them out from the bushes under the
trees, sending them across the meadow&mdash;fleeing
like a routed army before the bayonets of the East.
Every spring for a century at least the daffodils
had bloomed there.</p>

<p>Amaryllis did not stay to think of the century,
but ran round the corner of the house, and came
face to face with the east wind, which took her
with such force as to momentarily stay her progress.
Her skirts were blown out horizontally,
her ankles were exposed, and the front line of her
shape (beginning to bud like spring) was sketched
against the red brick wall. She laughed, but the
strong gale filled her throat as if a hand had been
thrust down it; the wind got its edge like a knife
under her eyelids, between them and the eyeballs,
and seemed as if it would scoop them out; her
eyes were wet with involuntary tears; her lips
dried up and parched in a moment. The wind
went through her thick stockings as if the wool
was nothing. She lifted her hand to defend her
eyes, and the skin of her arm became "goosey"
directly. Had she worn hat or bonnet it would
have flown. Stooping forwards, she pushed step
by step, and gradually reached the shelter of the
high garden wall; there she could stand upright,
and breathe again.</p>

<p>Her lips, which had been whitened by the keen
blast, as if a storm of ice particles had been driven<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
against them, now resumed their scarlet, but her
ears were full of dust and reddened, and her curly
dark hair was dry and rough and without gloss.
Each separate hair separated itself from the next,
and would not lie smooth&mdash;the natural unctuous
essence which usually caused them to adhere was
dried up.</p>

<p>The wind had blown thus round that corner
every March for a century, and in no degree
abated its bitter force because a beautiful human
child, full of the happiness of a flower, came carelessly
into its power. Nothing ever shows the
least consideration for human creatures.</p>

<p>The moss on the ridge of the wall under which
she stood to breathe looked shrivelled and thin,
the green tint dried out of it. A sparrow with a
straw tried hard to reach the eaves of the house to
put it in his nest, but the depending straw was
caught by the breeze as a sail, and carried him
past.</p>

<p>Under the wall was a large patch recently dug,
beside the patch a grass path, and on the path a
wheelbarrow. A man was busy putting in
potatoes; he wore the raggedest coat ever seen
on a respectable back. As the wind lifted the
tails it was apparent that the lining was loose and
only hung by threads, the cuffs were worn through,
there was a hole beneath each arm, and on each
shoulder the nap of the cloth was gone; the colour,
which had once been grey, was now a mixture of
several soils and numerous kinds of grit. The hat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
he had on was no better; it might have been made
of some hard pasteboard, it was so bare. Every
now and then the wind brought a few handfuls of
dust over the wall from the road, and dropped it
on his stooping back.</p>

<p>The way in which he was planting potatoes was
wonderful, every potato was placed at exactly the
right distance apart, and a hole made for it in the
general trench; before it was set it was looked at
and turned over, and the thumb rubbed against it
to be sure that it was sound, and when finally put
in, a little mould was delicately adjusted round to
keep it in its right position till the whole row was
buried. He carried the potatoes in his coat
pocket&mdash;those, that is, for the row&mdash;and took them
out one by one; had he been planting his own
children he could not have been more careful.
The science, the skill, and the experience brought
to this potato-planting you would hardly credit;
for all this care was founded upon observation, and
arose from very large abilities on the part of the
planter, though directed to so humble a purpose at
that moment.</p>

<p>So soon as Amaryllis had recovered breath, she
ran down the grass path and stood by the wheelbarrow,
but although her shadow fell across the
potato row, he would not see her.</p>

<p>"Pa," she said, not very loud. "Pa," growing
bolder. "Do come&mdash;there's a daffodil out, the very,
very first."</p>

<p>"Oh," a sound like a growl&mdash;"oh," from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
depth of a vast chest heaving out a doubtful
note.</p>

<p>"It is such a beautiful colour!"</p>

<p>"Where is your mother?" looking at her
askance and still stooping.</p>

<p>"Indoors&mdash;at least&mdash;I think&mdash;no&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Haven't you got no sewing? Can't you help
her? What good be you on?"</p>

<p>"But this is such a lovely daffodil, and the very
first&mdash;now do come!"</p>

<p>"Flowers bean't no use on; such trumpery as
that; what do'ee want a-messing about arter
thaay? You'll never be no good on; you ain't
never got a apron on."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;just a minute now."</p>

<p>"Go on in, and be some use on."</p>

<p>Amaryllis' lip fell; she turned and walked slowly
away along the path, her head drooping forward.</p>

<p>Did ever anyone have a beautiful idea or feeling
without being repulsed?</p>

<p>She had not reached the end of the path, however,
when the father began to change his attitude;
he stood up, dropped his "dibbler," scraped his
foot on his spade, and, grumbling to himself, went
after her. She did not see or hear him till he
overtook her.</p>

<p>"Please, I'll go and do the sewing," she said.</p>

<p>"Where be this yer flower?" gruffly.</p>

<p>"I'll show you," taking his ragged arm, and
brightening up immediately. "Only think, to
open in all this wind, and so cold&mdash;isn't it beautiful?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
It's much more beautiful than the flowers
that come in the summer."</p>

<p>"Trumpery rubbish&mdash;mean to dig 'em all up&mdash;would
if I had time," muttered the father. "Have
'em carted out and drowed away&mdash;do for ashes to
drow on the fields. Never no good on to nobody,
thaay thengs. You can't eat 'em, can you, like
you can potatoes?"</p>

<p>"But it's lovely. Here it is," and Amaryllis
stepped on the patch tenderly, and lifted up the
drooping face of the flower.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes," said Iden, putting his left hand to
his chin, a habit of his when thinking, and suddenly
quite altering his pronunciation from that of the
country folk and labourers amongst whom he dwelt
to the correct accent of education. "Ah, yes;
the daffodil was your great-uncle's favourite
flower."</p>

<p>"Richard?" asked Amaryllis.</p>

<p>"Richard," repeated Iden. And Amaryllis,
noting how handsome her father's intellectual face
looked, wandered in her mind from the flower as
he talked, and marvelled how he could be so rough
sometimes, and why he talked like the labourers,
and wore a ragged coat&mdash;he who was so full of
wisdom in his other moods, and spoke, and thought,
and indeed acted as a perfect gentleman.</p>

<p>"Richard's favourite flower," he went on. "He
brought the daffodils down from Luckett's; every
one in the garden came from there. He was
always reading poetry, and writing, and sketching,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
and yet he was such a capital man of business; no
one could understand that. He built the mill, and
saved heaps of money; he bought back the old
place at Luckett's, which belonged to us before
Queen Elizabeth's days; indeed, he very nearly
made up the fortunes Nicholas and the rest of
them got rid of. He was, indeed, a man. And
now it is all going again&mdash;faster than he made it.
He used to take you on his knee and say you would
walk well, because you had a good ankle."</p>

<p>Amaryllis blushed and smoothed her dress with
her hands, as if that would lengthen the skirt and
hide the ankles which Richard, the great-uncle,
had admired when she was a child, being a man,
but which her feminine acquaintances told her
were heavy.</p>

<p>"Here, put on your hat and scarf; how foolish
of you to go out in this wind without them!" said
Mrs. Iden, coming out. She thrust them into
Amaryllis' unwilling hands, and retired indoors
again immediately.</p>

<p>"He was the only one of all the family," continued
her father, "who could make money; all
the rest could do nothing but spend it. For ten
generations he was the only money-maker and
saver, and yet he was as free and liberal as possible.
Very curious, wasn't it?&mdash;only one in ten generations&mdash;difficult
to understand why none of the
others&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;" He paused, thinking.</p>

<p>Amaryllis, too, was silent, thinking&mdash;thinking
how easily her papa could make money, great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
heaps of money. She was sure he could if he
tried, instead of planting potatoes.</p>

<p>"If only another Richard would rise up like
him!" said Iden.</p>

<p>This was a very unreasonable wish, for, having
had one genius in the family, and that, too, in the
memory of man, they could not expect another.
Even vast empires rarely produce more than one
great man in all the course of their history. There
was but one C&aelig;sar in the thousand years of
Rome; Greece never had one as a nation, unless
we except Themistocles, or unless we accept
Alexander, who was a Macedonian; Persia had a
Cyrus; there was a Tamerlane somewhere, but few
people know anything of the empire he overshadows
with his name; France has had two
mighty warriors, Charlemagne and Napoleon&mdash;unfortunate
France! As for ourselves, fortunate
islanders! we have never had a great man so
immensely great as to overtop the whole, like
Charlemagne in his day. Fortunate for us, indeed,
that it has been so. But the best example to the
point is the case of the immense empire of Russia,
which has had one Peter the Great, and one only.
Great-uncle Richard was the Peter the Great of
his family, whose work had been slowly undone by
his successors.</p>

<p>"I wonder whether any of us will ever turn out
like Richard," continued Iden. "No one could
deny him long; he had a way of persuading and
convincing people, and always got his own will in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
the end. Wonderful man!" he pondered, returning
towards his work.</p>

<p>Suddenly the side door opened, and Mrs. Iden
just peered out, and cried, "Put your hat and scarf
on directly."</p>

<p>Amaryllis put the hat on, and wound the scarf
very loosely about her neck. She accompanied
her father to the potato patch, hoping that he
would go on talking, but he was quickly absorbed
in the potatoes. She watched him stooping till his
back was an arch; in fact, he had stooped so much
that now he could not stand upright, though still
in the prime of life; if he stood up and stretched
himself, still his back was bowed at the shoulders.
He worked so hard&mdash;ever since she could remember
she had seen him working like this; he was up in
the morning while it was yet dark tending the
cattle; sometimes he was up all night with them,
wind or weather made no difference. Other people
stopped indoors if it rained much, but it made no
difference to her father, nor did the deep snow or
the sharp frosts. Always at work, and he could
talk so cleverly, too, and knew everything, and yet
they were so short of money. How could this be?</p>

<p>What a fallacy it is that hard work is the making
of money; I could show you plenty of men who
have worked the whole of their lives as hard as ever
could possibly be, and who are still as far off independence
as when they began. In fact, that is the
rule; the winning of independence is rarely the result
of work, else nine out of ten would be well-to-do.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER II.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 117px;">
<img src="images/p.png" width="117" height="120" alt="P" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>RESENTLY Amaryllis wandered indoors,
and was met in the hall by her
mother.</div>

<p>"What has he been talking to you
about?" she said, angrily. "Don't
listen to him. He will never do any good. Just
look at his coat; it's a disgrace, a positive disgrace.
Telling you about the old people? What's
the use of talking of people who have been dead
all this time? Why doesn't he do something himself?
Don't listen to his rubbish&mdash;wasting his
time there with potatoes, it is enough to make one
wild! Why doesn't he go in to market and buy
and sell cattle, and turn over money in that way?
Not he! he'd rather muddle with a few paltry
potatoes, as if it mattered an atom how they were
stuck in the ground."</p>

<p>Not liking to hear her father abused, Amaryllis
went upstairs, and when she was alone lifted her
skirt and looked at the ankles which great-uncle
Richard had admired. Other girls had told her
they were thick, and she was ashamed of them.</p>

<p>Instead of the slender things which seem as if a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
sudden strain would snap them, and are nothing
but mere bone, she had a pair of well-shaped
ankles, justly proportioned to what would soon be
a fine form; strong, but neither thick, nor coarse,
nor heavy, ankles that would carry her many a
mile without weariness, that ended good legs with
plenty of flesh on them. The stupidity of calling
such coarse or heavy! They were really ideal
ankles, such as a sculptor would carve. Yet these
ill-instructed girls called them coarse! It was not
their fault, it was the lack of instruction; as they
did not know what was physically perfect, of course
they could not recognize it.</p>

<p>Let every girl who has such ankles be proud of
them, for they will prove a blessing to her for the
whole of her life.</p>

<p>Amaryllis could not get her hair smooth, though
she brushed it for some time; it would not lie close,
so much had the east wind dried it. She opened
a drawer, and took out a little bottle of macassar,
and held it in her hand, balancing probabilities.
Would her father see it if she used it, or might he,
perhaps, fail to notice? She dared not leave the
bottle on the dressing-table, for if he had chanced
to pass through the room he would certainly have
thrown it out of window, so bitter was his antagonism
to all oils and perfumes, scents, pomades, and
other resources of the hairdresser, which he held
defiled the hair and ruined it, to the deception of
woman and the disgust of man. Not one drop of
scent did Amaryllis dare to sprinkle on her handkerchief,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
not one drop of oil did she dare put on
her beautiful hair unless surreptitiously, and then
she could not go near him, for he was certain to
detect it and scorch her with withering satire.</p>

<p>Yet, however satirized, feminine faith in perfumes
and oils and so forth is like a perennial
spring, and never fails.</p>

<p>Such splendid hair as Amaryllis possessed needed
no dressing&mdash;nothing could possibly improve it,
and the chances therefore were that whatever she
used would injure&mdash;yet in her heart she yearned to
rub it with oil.</p>

<p>But the more she considered the more probable
it seemed that her father would detect her; she
had better wait till he went out for the afternoon
somewhere, an event that seldom occurred, for Iden
was one of those who preferred working at home to
rambling abroad. He was, indeed, too attached to
his home work. So she returned the bottle to the
drawer, and hid it under some stockings.</p>

<p>Immediately afterwards it was dinner-time. At
all meals the rule was that there must be no talking,
but at dinner the law was so strict that even to
ask for anything, as a piece of bread, or to say so
much as "Give me the salt, please," was a deadly
sin. There must be absolute silence while the
master ate. The least infringement was visited
with a severe glance from his keen and brilliant
blue eyes&mdash;there are no eyes so stern as blue eyes
when angry&mdash;or else he uttered a deep sigh like a
grunt, and sat rigidly upright for a moment. For<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
he usually stooped, and to sit upright showed
annoyance. No laws of the Medes and Persians
were ever obeyed as was this law of silence in that
house.</p>

<p>Anything that disturbed the absolute calm of the
dinner hour was worse than sacrilege; anything
that threatened to disturb it was watched intently
by that repressive eye. No one must come in or
go out of the room; if anyone knocked at the
door (there are no bells in old country houses)
there was a frown immediately, it necessitated someone
answering it, and then Mrs. Iden or Amaryllis
had to leave the table, to go out and open and
shut the sitting-room door as they went, and again
as they returned. Amaryllis dreaded a knock at
the door, it was so awful to have to stir once they
had sat down to dinner, and the servant was certain
not to know what reply to give. Sometimes it
happened&mdash;and this was very terrible&mdash;that the
master himself had to go, some one wanted him
about some hay or a horse and cart, and no one
could tell what to do but the master. A dinner
broken up in this way was a very serious matter
indeed.</p>

<p>That day they had a leg of mutton&mdash;a special
occasion&mdash;a joint to be looked on reverently. Mr.
Iden had walked into the town to choose it himself
some days previously, and brought it home on foot
in a flag basket. The butcher would have sent it,
and if not, there were men on the farm who could
have fetched it, but it was much too important to be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
left to a second person. No one could do it right
but Mr. Iden himself. There was a good deal of
reason in this personal care of the meat, for it is a
certain fact that unless you do look after such
things yourself, and that persistently, too, you
never get it first-rate. For this cause people in
grand villas scarcely ever have anything worth
eating on their tables. Their household expenses
reach thousands yearly, and yet they rarely have
anything eatable, and their dinner-tables can never
show meat, vegetables, or fruit equal to Mr. Iden's.
The meat was dark brown, as mutton should be,
for if it is the least bit white it is sure to be poor;
the grain was short, and ate like bread and butter,
firm, and yet almost crumbling to the touch; it was
full of juicy red gravy, and cut pleasantly, the
knife went through it nicely; you can tell good
meat directly you touch it with the knife. It was
cooked to a turn, and had been done at a wood fire
on a hearth; no oven taste, no taint of coal gas
or carbon; the pure flame of wood had browned it.
Such emanations as there may be from burning
logs are odorous of the woodland, of the sunshine,
of the fields and fresh air; the wood simply gives
out as it burns the sweetness it has imbibed through
its leaves from the atmosphere which floats above
grass and flowers. Essences of this order, if they
do penetrate the fibres of the meat, add to its
flavour a delicate aroma. Grass-fed meat, cooked
at a wood fire, for me.</p>

<p>Wonderful it is that wealthy people can endure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
to have their meat cooked over coal or in a shut-up
iron box, where it kills itself with its own steam,
which ought to escape. But then wealthy villa
people do do odd things. <i>Les Mis&eacute;rables</i> who
have to write like myself must put up with anything
and be thankful for permission to exist; but
people with mighty incomes from tea, or crockery-ware,
or mud, or bricks and mortar&mdash;why on earth
these happy and favoured mortals do not live like
the gods passes understanding.</p>

<p>Parisian people use charcoal: perhaps Paris
will convert some of you who will not listen to a
farmer.</p>

<p>Mr. Iden had himself grown the potatoes that
were placed before him. They were white, floury,
without a drop of water in the whole dish of them.
They were equal to the finest bread&mdash;far, far superior
to the bread with which the immense city of
London permits itself to be poisoned. (It is not
much better, for it destroys the digestion.) This,
too, with wheat at thirty shillings the quarter, a
price which is in itself one of the most wonderful
things of the age. The finest bread ought to be
cheap.</p>

<p>"They be forty-folds," said Mr. Iden, helping
himself to half a dozen. "Look at the gravy go
up into um like tea up a knob of sugar."</p>

<p>The gravy was drawn up among the dry, floury
particles of the potatoes as if they had formed
capillary tubes.</p>

<p>"Forty-folds," he repeated; "they comes forty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
to one. It be an amazing theng how thengs do
that; forty grows for one. Thaay be an old-fashioned
potato; you won't find many of thaay, not true forty-folds.
Mine comes true, 'cause I saves um every
year a' purpose. Better take more than that (to
Amaryllis)&mdash;you haven't got but two" (to Mrs.
Iden).</p>

<p>What he ate other people at his table must eat,
and the largest quantity possible. No one else
must speak, hardly to say "Yes" or "No," but
the master could talk, talk, talk without end. The
only talking that might be done by others was in
praise of the edibles on the table by Iden so carefully
provided. You might admire the potatoes or
the mutton, but you must not talk on any other
subject. Nor was it safe even to do that, because
if you said, "What capital potatoes!" you were
immediately helped to another plateful, and had to
finish them, want them or not. If you praised the
mutton several thick slices were placed on your
plate, and woe to you if you left a particle. It was
no use to try and cover over what you could not
manage with knife and fork; it was sure to be seen.
"What bean't you going to yet (eat) up that there
juicy bit, you?"</p>

<p>Amaryllis and Mrs. Iden, warned by previous
experience, discreetly refrained from admiring either
mutton or potatoes.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'>ORTY-FOLDS," went on the master,
"be the best keeping potatoes. Thur
be so many new sorts now, but they
bean't no good; they be very good for
gentlefolk as doan't know no better,
and poor folk as can't help theirselves. They won't
grow everywhere neither; there bean't but one
patch in our garden as ull grow 'um well. It's
that's big middle patch. Summat different in the
soil thur. There's a lot, bless you! to be learned
before you can grow a potato, for all it looks such
a simple thing. Farty-folds&mdash;&mdash;"</div>

<p>"Farty-folds!" said Mrs. Iden, imitating his
provincial pronunciation with extreme disgust in
her tone.</p>

<p>"Aw, yes, too," said Iden. "Varty-volds be
ould potatoes, and thur bean't none as can beat
um."</p>

<p>The more she showed her irritation at his speech
or ways, the more he accentuated both language and
manner.</p>

<p>"Talking with your mouth full," said Mrs. Iden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
It was true, Iden did talk with his mouth full, very
full indeed, for he fed heartily. The remark annoyed
him; he grunted and spluttered and choked
a little&mdash;floury things are choky. He got it down
by taking a long draught at his quart of strong ale.
Splendid ale it was, too, the stuff to induce you to
make faces at Goliath. He soon began to talk
again.</p>

<p>"Th' ould shepherd fetched me these swede
greens; I axed un three days ago; I know'd we
was going to have this yer mutton. You got to
settle these yer things aforehand."</p>

<p>"Axed," muttered Mrs. Iden.</p>

<p>"Th' pigeons have been at um, they be 'mazing
fond of um, so be the larks. These be the best
as thur was. They be the best things in the world
for the blood. Swede greens be the top of all
physic. If you can get fresh swede tops you don't
want a doctor within twenty miles. Their's
nothing in all the chemists' shops in England
equal to swede greens"&mdash;helping himself to a
large quantity of salt.</p>

<p>"What a lot of salt you <i>do</i> eat!" muttered Mrs.
Iden.</p>

<p>"Onely you must have the real swedes&mdash;not
thuck stuff they sells in towns; greens they was
once p'rhaps, but they be tough as leather, and
haven't got a drop of sap in um. Swedes is onely
to be got about March."</p>

<p>"Pooh! you can get them at Christmas in
London," said Mrs. Iden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>"Aw, can 'ee? Call they swede tops? They
bean't no good; you might as well eat dried
leaves. I tell you these are the young fresh green
shoots of spring"&mdash;suddenly changing his pronunciation
as he became interested in his subject and
forgot the shafts of irritation shot at him by his
wife. "They are full of sap&mdash;fresh sap&mdash;the juice
which the plant extracts from the earth as the
active power of the sun's rays increases. It is this
sap which is so good for the blood. Without it
the vegetable is no more than a woody fibre. Why
the sap should be so powerful I cannot tell you;
no one knows, any more than they know <i>how</i> the
plant prepares it. This is one of those things
which defy analysis&mdash;the laboratory is at fault, and
can do nothing with it." ("More salt!" muttered
Mrs. Iden. "How can you eat such a quantity of
salt?") "There is something beyond what the
laboratory can lay hands on; something that cannot
be weighed, or seen, or estimated, neither by
quantity, quality, or by any means. They analyse
champagne, for instance; they find so many parts
water, so much sugar, so much this, and so much
that; but out of the hundred parts there remain
ten&mdash;I think it is ten&mdash;at all events so many parts
still to be accounted for. They escape, they are
set down as volatile&mdash;the laboratory has not even a
distinct name for this component; the laboratory
knows nothing at all about it, cannot even name it.
But this unknown constituent is the real champagne.
So it is with the sap. In spring the sap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
possesses a certain virtue; at other times of the
year the leaf is still green, but useless to us."</p>

<p>"I shall have some vinegar," said Mrs. Iden,
defiantly, stretching out her hand to the cruet.</p>

<p>Mr. Iden made a wry face, as if the mere mention
of vinegar had set his teeth on edge. He
looked the other way and ate as fast as he could, to
close his eyes to the spectacle of any one spoiling
the sappy swede greens with nauseous vinegar.
To his system of edible philosophy vinegar was
utterly antagonistic&mdash;destructive of the sap-principle,
altogether wrong, and, in fact, wicked, as
destroying good and precious food.</p>

<p>Amaryllis would not have dared to have taken
the vinegar herself, but as her mother passed the
cruet to her, she, too, fell away, and mixed vinegar
with the green vegetables. All women like
vinegar.</p>

<p>When the bottle was restored to the cruet-stand
Mr. Iden deigned to look round again at the
table.</p>

<p>"Ha! you'll cut your thumb!" he shouted to
Amaryllis, who was cutting a piece of bread. She
put the loaf down with a consciousness of guilt.
"Haven't I told you how to cut bread twenty
times? Cutting towards your thumb like that!
Hold your left hand lower down, so that if the knife
slips it will go over. Here, like this. Give it
to me."</p>

<p>He cut a slice to show her, and then tossed the
slice across the table so accurately that it fell<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
exactly into its proper place by her plate. He
had a habit of tossing things in that way.</p>

<p>"Why ever couldn't you pass it on the tray?"
said Mrs. Iden. "Flinging in that manner! I
hate to see it."</p>

<p>Amaryllis, as in duty bound, in appearance took
the lesson in bread-cutting to heart, as she had
done twenty times before. But she knew she
should still cut a loaf in the same dangerous style
when out of his sight. She could not do it in the
safe way&mdash;it was so much easier in the other; and
if she did cut her hand she did not greatly care.</p>

<p>"Now perhaps you'll remember," said the
master, getting up with his plate in his hand.</p>

<p>"Whatever <i>are</i> you going to do now?" asked
Mrs. Iden, who knew perfectly well.</p>

<p>"Going to warm the plate." He went out into
the kitchen, sat down by the fire, and carefully
warmed his plate for a second helping.</p>

<p>"I should think you couldn't want any more,"
said Mrs. Iden when he came back. "You had
enough the first time for three."</p>

<p>But Iden, who had the appetite of a giant, and
had never ruined his digestion with vinegar or
sauces, piled another series of thick slices on his
plate, now hot to liquefy the gravy, and added to
the meat a just proportion of vegetables. In proportion
and a just mixture the secret of eating
successfully consisted, according to him.</p>

<p>First he ate a piece of the dark brown mutton,
this was immediately followed by a portion of floury<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
potato, next by a portion of swede tops, and then,
lest a too savoury taste should remain in the mouth,
he took a fragment of bread, as it were to sweeten
and cleanse his teeth. Finally came a draught of
strong ale, and after a brief moment the same ingredients
were mixed in the same order as before.
His dinner was thus eaten in a certain order, and
with a kind of rhythm, duly exciting each particular
flavour like a rhyme in its proper position,
and duly putting it out with its correct successor.
Always the savour of meat and gravy and vegetables
had to be toned down by the ultimate bread,
a vast piece of which he kept beside him. He
was a great bread eater&mdash;it was always bread after
everything, and if there were two courses then bread
between to prepare the palate, and to prevent the
sweets from quarrelling with the acids. Organization
was the chief characteristic of his mind&mdash;his
very dinner was organized and well planned, and
any break or disturbance was not so much an annoyance
in itself as destructive of a clever design,
like a stick thrust through the web of a geometrical
spider.</p>

<p>This order of mouthfuls had been explained over
and over again to the family, and if they felt that
he was in a more than usually terrible mood, and if
they felt his gaze upon them, the family to some
extent submitted. Neither Mrs. Iden nor Amaryllis,
however, could ever educate their palates
into this fixed sequence of feeding; and, if Iden
was not in a very awful and Jovelike mood, they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
wandered about irregularly in their eating. When
the dinner was over (and, indeed, before it began)
they had a way of visiting the larder, and "picking"
little fragments of pies, or cold fowl, even a cold
potato, the smallest mug&mdash;a quarter of a pint of
the Goliath ale between them, or, if it was to be
had, a sip of port wine. These women were very
irrational in their feeding; they actually put vinegar
on cold cabbage; they gloated over a fragment of
pickled salmon about eleven o'clock in the morning.
They had a herring sometimes for tea&mdash;the smell of
it cooking sent the master into fits of indignation,
he abominated it so, but they were so hardened
and lost to righteousness they always repeated the
offence next time the itinerant fish-dealer called.
You could not drum them into good solid, straightforward
eating.</p>

<p>They generally had a smuggled bit of pastry to
eat in the kitchen after dinner, for Mr. Iden considered
that no one could need a second course
after first-rate mutton and forty-folds. A morsel
of cheese if you liked&mdash;nothing more. In summer
the great garden abounded with fruit; he would
have nothing but rhubarb, rhubarb, rhubarb, day
after day, or else black-currant pudding. He held
that black currants were the most wholesome fruit
that grew; if he fancied his hands were not quite
clean he would rub them with black-currant leaves
to give them a pleasant aromatic odour (as ladies
use scented soap). He rubbed them with walnut-leaves
for the same purpose.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>Of salad in its season he was a great eater,
cucumber especially, and lettuce and celery; but
a mixed salad (oil and a flash, as it were, of Worcester
sauce) was a horror to him. A principle
ran through all his eating&mdash;an idea, a plan and
design.</p>

<p>I assure you it is a very important matter this
eating, a man's fortune depends on his dinner. I
should have been as rich as Cr&oelig;sus if I could only
have eaten what I liked all my time; I am sure I
should, now I come to look back.</p>

<p>The soundest and most wholesome food in the
world was set on Mr. Iden's table; you may differ
from his system, but you would have enjoyed the
dark brown mutton, the floury potatoes, the fresh
vegetables and fruit and salad, and the Goliath ale.</p>

<p>When he had at last finished his meal he took
his knife and carefully scraped his crumbs together,
drawing the edge along the cloth, first one way and
then the other, till he had a little heap; for, eating
so much bread, he made many crumbs. Having
got them together, he proceeded to shovel them
into his mouth with the end of his knife, so that
not one was wasted. Sometimes he sprinkled a
little moist sugar over them with his finger and
thumb. He then cut himself a slice of bread and
cheese, and sat down with it in his arm-chair by
the fire, spreading his large red-and-yellow silk
handkerchief on his knee to catch the fragments in
lieu of a plate.</p>

<p>"Why can't you eat your cheese at the table,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
like other people?" said Mrs. Iden, shuffling her
feet with contemptuous annoyance. A deep grunt
in the throat was the answer she received; at the
same time he turned his arm-chair more towards
the fire, as much as to say, "Other people are
nothing to me."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 121px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="121" height="120" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HIS arm-chair, of old-fashioned make,
had lost an arm&mdash;the screw remained
sticking up, but the woodwork on that
side was gone. It had been accidentally
broken some ten years since; yet,
although he used the chair every day, the arm had
never been mended. Awkward as it was, he let it
alone.</div>

<p>"Hum! where's <i>The Standard</i>, then?" he said
presently, as he nibbled his cheese and sipped the
ale which he had placed on the hob.</p>

<p>"Here it is, Pa," said Amaryllis, hastening with
the paper.</p>

<p>"Thought you despised the papers?" said Mrs.
Iden. "Thought there was nothing but lies and
rubbish in them, according to you?"</p>

<p>"No more thur bean't."</p>

<p>"You always take good care to read them,
though."</p>

<p>"Hum!" Another deep grunt, and another
slight turn of the chair. He could not answer this
charge of inconsistency, for it was a fact that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
affected to despise the newspaper and yet read it
with avidity, and would almost as soon have missed
his ale as his news.</p>

<p>However, to settle with his conscience, he had a
manner of holding the paper half aslant a good way
from him, and every now and then as he read
uttered a dissentient or disgusted grunt.</p>

<p>The master's taking up his paper was a signal
for all other persons to leave the room, and not to
return till he had finished his news and his nap.</p>

<p>Mrs. Iden and Amaryllis, as they went out, each
took as many of the dishes as they could carry,
for it was uncertain when they could come in again
to clear the table. The cloth must not be moved,
the door opened, or the slightest sound heard till
the siesta was over.</p>

<p>"Can't clear the dinner things till four o'clock,"
said Mrs. Iden as she went, "and then you want
your tea&mdash;senseless!" Amaryllis shut the door,
and the master was left to himself.</p>

<p>By-and-by, his cheese being finished, he dropped
his newspaper, and arranged himself for slumber.
His left elbow he carefully fitted to the remnant of
the broken woodwork of the chair. The silk handkerchief,
red and yellow, he gathered into a loose
pad in his left hand for his cheek and temple to
rest on. His face was thus supported by his hand
and arm, while the side of his head touched and
rested against the wainscot of the wall.</p>

<p>Just where his head touched it the wainscot had
been worn away by the daily pressure, leaving a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
round spot. The wood was there exposed&mdash;a
round spot, an inch or two in diameter, being
completely bare of varnish. So many nods&mdash;the
attrition of thirty years and more of nodding&mdash;had
gradually ground away the coat with which the
painter had originally covered the wood. It even
looked a little hollow&mdash;a little depressed&mdash;as if his
head had scooped out a shallow crater; but this was
probably an illusion, the eye being deceived by the
difference in colour between the wood and the varnish
around it.</p>

<p>This human mark reminded one of the grooves
worn by the knees of generations of worshippers in
the sacred steps of the temple which they ascended
on all-fours. It was, indeed, a mark of devotion,
as Mrs. Iden and others, not very keen observers,
would have said, to the god of Sleep; in truth, it
was a singular instance of continued devotion at the
throne of the god of Thought.</p>

<p>It was to think that Mr. Iden in the commencement
assumed this posture of slumber, and commanded
silence. But thought which has been
cultivated for a third of a century is apt to tone
down to something very near somnolence.</p>

<p>That panel of wainscot was, in fact, as worthy
of preservation as those on which the early artists
delineated the Madonna and Infant, and for which
high prices are now paid. It was intensely&mdash;superlatively&mdash;human.
Worn in slow time by a
human head within which a great mind was working
under the most unhappy conditions, it had the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
deep value attaching to inanimate things which
have witnessed intolerable suffering.</p>

<p>I am not a Roman Catholic, but I must confess
that if I could be assured any particular piece of
wood had really formed a part of the Cross I
should think it the most valuable thing in the world,
to which Koh-i-noors would be mud.</p>

<p>I am a pagan, and think the heart and soul above
crowns.</p>

<p>That panel was in effect a cross on which a heart
had been tortured for the third of a century, that
is, for the space of time allotted to a generation.</p>

<p>That mark upon the panel had still a further
meaning, it represented the unhappiness, the misfortunes,
the Nemesis of two hundred years. This
family of Idens had endured already two hundred
years of unhappiness and discordance for no original
fault of theirs, simply because they had once been
fortunate of old time, and therefore they had to
work out that hour of sunshine to the utmost depths
of shadow.</p>

<p>The panel of the wainscot upon which that mark
had been worn was in effect a cross upon which a
human heart had been tortured&mdash;and thought can,
indeed, torture&mdash;for a third of a century. For
Iden had learned to know himself, and despaired.</p>

<p>Not long after he had settled himself and closed
his eyes the handle of the door was very softly
turned, and Amaryllis stole in for her book, which
she had forgotten. She succeeded in getting it on
tiptoe without a sound, but in shutting the door the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
lock clicked, and she heard him kick the fender
angrily with his iron-shod heel.</p>

<p>After that there was utter silence, except the
ticking of the American clock&mdash;a loud and distinct
tick in the still (and in that sense vacant)
room.</p>

<p>Presently a shadow somewhat darkened the
window, a noiseless shadow; Mrs. Iden had come
quietly round the house, and stood in the March
wind, watching the sleeping man. She had a shawl
about her shoulders&mdash;she put out her clenched hand
from under its folds, and shook her fist at him,
muttering to herself, "Never <i>do</i> anything; nothing
but sleep, sleep, sleep: talk, talk, talk; never <i>do</i>
anything. That's what I hate."</p>

<p>The noiseless shadow disappeared; the common
American clock continued its loud tick, tick.</p>

<p>Slight sounds, faint rustlings, began to be
audible among the cinders in the fender. The dry
cinders were pushed about by something passing
between them. After a while a brown mouse
peered out at the end of the fender under Iden's
chair, looked round a moment, and went back to
the grate. In a minute he came again, and ventured
somewhat farther across the width of the
white hearthstone to the verge of the carpet. This
advance was made step by step, but on reaching
the carpet the mouse rushed home to cover in one
run&mdash;like children at "touch wood," going out
from a place of safety very cautiously, returning
swiftly. The next time another mouse followed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
and a third appeared at the other end of the fender.
By degrees they got under the table, and helped
themselves to the crumbs; one mounted a chair
and reached the cloth, but soon descended, afraid
to stay there. Five or six mice were now busy at
their dinner.</p>

<p>The sleeping man was as still and quiet as if
carved.</p>

<p>A mouse came to the foot, clad in a great rusty-hued
iron-shod boot&mdash;the foot that rested on the
fender, for he had crossed his knees. His ragged
and dingy trouser, full of March dust, and earth-stained
by labour, was drawn up somewhat higher
than the boot. It took the mouse several trials to
reach the trouser, but he succeeded, and audaciously
mounted to Iden's knee. Another quickly followed,
and there the pair of them feasted on the
crumbs of bread and cheese caught in the folds of
his trousers.</p>

<p>One great brown hand was in his pocket, close
to them&mdash;a mighty hand, beside which they were
pigmies indeed in the land of the giants. What would
have been the value of their lives between a finger
and thumb that could crack a ripe and strong-shelled
walnut?</p>

<p>The size&mdash;the mass&mdash;the weight of his hand
alone was as a hill overshadowing them; his broad
frame like the Alps; his head high above as a vast
rock that overhung the valley.</p>

<p>His thumb-nail&mdash;widened by labour with spade
and axe&mdash;his thumb-nail would have covered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
either of the tiny creatures as his shield covered
Ajax.</p>

<p>Yet the little things fed in perfect confidence.
He was so still, so <i>very</i> still&mdash;quiescent&mdash;they
feared him no more than they did the wall; they
could not hear his breathing.</p>

<p>Had they been gifted with human intelligence
that very fact would have excited their suspicions.
Why so very, <i>very</i> still? Strong men, wearied by
work, do not sleep quietly; they breathe heavily.
Even in firm sleep we move a little now and then, a
limb trembles, a muscle quivers, or stretches itself.</p>

<p>But Iden was so still it was evident he was really
wide awake and restraining his breath, and exercising
conscious command over his muscles, that
this scene might proceed undisturbed.</p>

<p>Now the strangeness of the thing was in this
way: Iden set traps for mice in the cellar and the
larder, and slew them there without mercy. He
picked up the trap, swung it round, opening the
door at the same instant, and the wretched captive
was dashed to death upon the stone flags of the
floor. So he hated them and persecuted them in
one place, and fed them in another.</p>

<p>A long psychological discussion might be held
on this apparent inconsistency, but I shall leave
analysis to those who like it, and go on recording
facts. I will only make one remark. That nothing
is consistent that is human. If it was not inconsistent
it would have no association with a living
person.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>From the merest thin slit, as it were, between
his eyelids, Iden watched the mice feed and run
about his knees till, having eaten every crumb, they
descended his leg to the floor.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 118px;">
<img src="images/h.png" width="118" height="120" alt="H" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>E was not asleep&mdash;he was thinking.
Sometimes, of course, it happened that
slumber was induced by the position
in which he placed himself; slumber,
however, was not his intent. He liked
to rest after his midday meal and think. There
was no real loss of time in it&mdash;he had been at work
since half-past five.</div>

<p>His especial and striking characteristic was a
very large, high, and noble forehead&mdash;the forehead
attributed to Shakespeare and seen in his busts.
Shakespeare's intellect is beyond inquiry, yet he
was not altogether a man of action. He was, indeed,
an actor upon the stage; once he stole the
red deer (delightful to think of that!), but he did
not sail to the then new discovered lands of America,
nor did he fight the Spaniards. So much intellect
is, perhaps, antagonistic to action, or rather
it is averse to those arts by which a soldier climbs
to the position of commander. If Shakespeare by
the chance of birth, or other accident, had had the
order of England's forces, we should have seen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
generalship such as the world had not known since
C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>His intellect was too big to climb backstairs till
opportunity came. We have great thoughts instead
of battles.</p>

<p>Iden's forehead might have been sculptured for
Shakespeare's. There was too much thought in it
for the circumstances of his life. It is possible to
think till you cannot act.</p>

<p>After the mice descended Iden did sleep for a
few minutes. When he awoke he looked at the
clock in a guilty way, and then opening the oven
of the grate, took out a baked apple. He had one
there ready for him almost always&mdash;always, that is,
when they were not ripe on the trees.</p>

<p>A baked apple, he said, was the most wholesome
thing in the world; it corrected the stomach, prevented
acidity, improved digestion, and gave tone
to all the food that had been eaten previously. If
people would only eat baked apples they would not
need to be for ever going to the chemists' shops
for drugs and salines to put them right. The
women were always at the chemists' shops&mdash;you
could never pass the chemists' shops in the town
without seeing two or three women buying something.</p>

<p>The apple was the apple of fruit, the natural
medicine of man&mdash;and the best flavoured. It was
compounded of the sweetest extracts and essences
of air and light, put together of sunshine and wind
and shower in such a way that no laboratory could<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
imitate: and so on in a strain and with a simplicity
of language that reminded you of Bacon and his
philosophy of the Elizabethan age.</p>

<p>Iden in a way certainly had a tinge of the Baconian
culture, naturally, and not from any study of
that author, whose books he had never seen. The
great Bacon was, in fact, a man of orchard and
garden, and gathered his ideas from the fields.</p>

<p>Just look at an apple on the tree, said Iden.
Look at a Blenheim orange, the inimitable mixture
of colour, the gold and bronze, and ruddy tints,
not bright colours&mdash;undertones of bright colours&mdash;smoothed
together and polished, and made the
more delightful by occasional roughness in the rind.
Or look at the brilliant King Pippin. Now he was
getting older he found, however, that the finest of
them all was the russet. For eating, at its proper
season, it was good, but for cooking it was simply
the Imperial C&aelig;sar and Sultan of apples; whether
for baking, or pies, or sauce, there was none to
equal it. Apple-sauce made of the real true russet
was a sauce for Jove's own table. It was necessary
that it should be the real russet. Indeed in apple
trees you had to be as careful of breeding and
pedigree as the owners of racing stables were about
their horses.</p>

<p>Ripe apples could not be got all the year round
in any variety; besides which, in winter and cold
weather the crudity of the stomach needed to be
assisted with a little warmth; therefore bake
them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>People did not eat nearly enough fruit now-a-days;
they had too much butcher's meat, and not
enough fruit&mdash;that is, home-grown fruit, straight
from orchard or garden, not the half-sour stuff sold
in the shops, picked before it was ready.</p>

<p>The Americans were much wiser (he knew a
good deal about America&mdash;he had been there in
his early days, before thought superseded action)&mdash;the
Americans had kept up many of the fine old
English customs of two or three hundred years
since, and among these was the eating of fruit.
They were accused of being so modern, so very,
very modern, but, in fact, the country Americans,
with whom he had lived (and who had taught him
how to chop) maintained much of the genuine
antique life of old England.</p>

<p>They had first-rate apples, yet it was curious that
the same trees produced an apple having a slightly
different flavour to what it had in this country.
You could always distinguish an American apple
by its peculiar piquancy&mdash;a sub-acid piquancy, a
wild strawberry piquancy, a sort of woodland,
forest, backwoods delicacy of its own. And so
on, and so on&mdash;"talk, talk, talk," as Mrs. Iden
said.</p>

<p>After his baked apple he took another guilty
look at the clock, it was close on four, and went
into the passage to get his hat. In farmhouses
these places are called passages; in the smallest of
villas, wretched little villas not fit to be called
houses, they are always "halls."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span></p>

<p>In the passage Mrs. Iden was waiting for him,
and began to thump his broad though bowed back
with all her might.</p>

<p>"Sleep, sleep, sleep!" she cried, giving him a
thump at each word. "You've slept two hours.
(Thump.) You sleep till you stupefy yourself
(thump), and then you go and dig. What's the
use of digging? (Thump.) Why don't you make
some money? (Thump.) Talk and sleep! (Thump.)
I hate it. (Thump.) You've rubbed the paint off
the wainscot with your sleep, sleep, sleep (thump)&mdash;there's
one of your hairs sticking to the paint
where your head goes. (Thump.) Anything
more hateful&mdash;sleep (thump), talk (thump), sleep
(thump). Go on!"</p>

<p>She had thumped him down the passage, and
across the covered-in court to the door opening on
the garden. There he paused to put on his hat&mdash;an
aged, battered hat&mdash;some sort of nondescript
bowler, broken, grey, weather-stained, very battered
and very aged&mdash;a pitiful hat to put above that
broad, Shakespearian forehead. While he fitted
it on he was thumped severely: when he opened
the door he paused, and involuntarily looked up at
the sky to see about the weather&mdash;a habit all
country people have&mdash;and so got more thumping,
ending as he started out with a tremendous push.
He did not seem to resent the knocks, nor did the
push accelerate his pace; he took it very much as
he took the March wind.</p>

<p>Mrs. Iden slammed the door, and went in to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
clear the dinner things, and make ready for tea.
Amaryllis helped her.</p>

<p>"He'll want his tea in half an hour," said Mrs.
Iden. "What's the use of his going out to work
for half an hour?"</p>

<p>Amaryllis was silent. She was very fond of her
father; he never did anything wrong in her eyes,
and she could have pointed out that when he sat
down to dinner at one he had already worked as
many hours as Mrs. Iden's model City gentleman
in a whole day. His dinner at one was, in effect,
equivalent to their dinner at seven or eight, over
which they frequently lingered an hour or two. He
would still go on labouring, almost another half day.
But she held her peace, for, on the other hand, she
could not contradict and argue with her mother,
whom she knew had had a wearisome life and
perpetual disappointments.</p>

<p>Mrs. Iden grumbled on to herself, working herself
into a more fiery passion, till at last she put
down the tea-pot, and rushed into the garden.
There as she came round the first thing she saw was
the daffodil, the beautiful daffodil Amaryllis had
discovered. Beside herself with indignation&mdash;what
was the use of flowers or potatoes?&mdash;Mrs.
Iden stepped on the border and trampled the flower
under foot till it was shapeless. After this she
rushed indoors again and upstairs to her bedroom,
where she locked herself in, and fumbled about in
the old black oak chest of drawers till she found a
faded lavender glove.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>That glove had been worn at the old "Ship"
at Brighton years and years ago in the honeymoon
trip: in those days bridal parties went down
by coach. Faded with years, it had also faded
from the tears that had fallen upon it. She turned
it over in her hands, and her tears spotted it once
more.</p>

<p>Amaryllis went on with the tea-making; for her
mother to rush away in that manner was nothing
new. She toasted her father a piece of toast&mdash;he
affected to despise toast, but he always ate it if it
was there, and looked about for it if it was not,
though he never said anything. The clock struck
five, and out she went to tell him tea was ready.
Coming round the house she found her daffodil
crushed to pieces.</p>

<p>"Oh!" The blood rushed to her forehead;
then her beautiful lips pouted and quivered; tears
filled her eyes, and her breast panted. She knew
immediately who had done it; she ran to her bedroom
to cry and to hide her grief and indignation.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 119px;">
<img src="images/l.png" width="119" height="120" alt="L" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>ADY-DAY Fair came round by and by,
and Amaryllis, about eleven o'clock in
the morning, went down the garden to
the end of the orchard, where she could
overlook the highway without being
seen, and watch the folk go past. Just there the
road began to descend into a hollow, while the
garden continued level, so that Amaryllis, leaning
her arm on the top of the wall, was much higher
up than those who went along. The wall dropped
quite fourteen feet down to the road, a rare red
brick wall&mdash;thick and closely-built, the bricks close
together with thin seams of mortar, so that the
fibres of the whole mass were worked and compressed
and bound firm, like the fibres of a piece of
iron. The deep red bricks had a colour&mdash;a certain
richness of stability&mdash;and at the top this good
piece of workmanship was protected from the
weather by a kind of cap, and ornamented with a
projecting ridge. Within the wall Amaryllis could
stand on a slight bank, and easily look over it.
Without there was a sheer red precipice of fourteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
feet down to the dusty sward and nettles beside
the road.</div>

<p>Some bare branches of a plum tree trained against
the wall rose thin and tapering above it in a bunch,
a sign of bad gardening, for they ought to have
been pruned, and the tree, indeed, had an appearance
of neglect. One heavy bough had broken
away from the nails and list, and drooped to the
ground, and the shoots of last year, not having
been trimmed, thrust themselves forward presumptuously.</p>

<p>Behind the bunch of thin and tapering branches
rising above the wall Amaryllis was partly hidden,
but she relied a great deal more for concealment
upon a fact Iden had taught her, that people very
seldom look up; and consequently if you are only
a little higher they will not see you. This she
proved that morning, for not one of all who passed
glanced up from the road. The shepherd kept his
eye fixed on his sheep, and the drover on his
bullocks; the boys were in a hurry to get to the
fair and spend their pennies; the wenches had
on a bit of blue ribbon or a new bonnet, and
were perpetually looking at the traps that overtook
them to see if the men admired their finery.
No one looked up from the road they were pursuing.</p>

<p>The photographer fixes the head of the sitter by
a sort of stand at the back, which holds it steady
in one position while the camera takes the picture.
In life most people have their heads fixed in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
claws of some miserable pettiness, which interests
them so greatly that they tramp on steadily forward,
staring ahead, and there's not the slightest
fear of their seeing anything outside the rut they
are travelling.</p>

<p>Amaryllis did not care anything about the fair
or the people either, knowing very well what sort
they would be; but I suspect, if it had been possible
to have got at the cause which brought her
there, it would have been traced to the unconscious
influence of sex, a perfectly innocent prompting,
quite unrecognised by the person who feels it, and
who would indignantly deny it if rallied on the subject,
but which leads girls of her age to seize
opportunities of observing the men, even if of an
uninteresting order. Still they are men, those
curious beings, that unknown race, and little bits of
knowledge about them may, perhaps, be picked up
by a diligent observer.</p>

<p>The men who drifted along the road towards the
Fair were no "mashers, by Jove!" Some of them,
though young, were clad antiquely enough in
breeches and gaiters&mdash;not sportsmen's breeches
and gaiters, but old-fashioned "granfer" things;
the most of them were stout and sturdy, in drab
and brown suits of good cloth, cut awry. Hundreds
of them on foot, in traps, gigs, fourwheels, and on
horseback, went under Amaryllis: but, though they
were all Christians, there was not one "worth a
Jewess' eye."</p>

<p>She scorned them all.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

<p>This member of the unknown race was too
thickly made, short set, and squat; this one too
fair&mdash;quite white and moist-sugar looking; this
one had a straight leg.</p>

<p>Another went by with a great thick and long
black beard&mdash;what a horrid thing, now, when
kissing!&mdash;and as he walked he wiped it with his
sleeve, for he had just washed down the dust with
a glass of ale. His neck, too, was red and thick;
hideous, yet he was a "stout knave," and a man
all over, as far as body makes a man.</p>

<p>But women are, like Shakespeare, better judges.
"Care I for the thews and sinews of a man?" They
look for something more than bulk.</p>

<p>A good many of these fellows were more or less
lame, for it is astonishing if you watch people go by
and keep account of them what a number have
game legs, both young and old.</p>

<p>A young buck on a capital horse was at the first
glance more interesting&mdash;paler, rakish, a cigar in
his mouth, an air of viciousness and dash combined,
fairly well dressed, pale whiskers and beard; in short,
he knew as much of the billiard-table as he did of
sheep and corn. When nearer Amaryllis disliked
him more than all the rest put together; she shrank
back a little from the wall lest he should chance to
look up; she would have feared to have been alone
with such a character, and yet she could not have
said why. She would not have feared to walk side
by side with the great black beard&mdash;hideous as he
was&mdash;nor with any of the rest, not even with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
roughest of the labourers who tramped along. This
gentleman alone alarmed her.</p>

<p>There were two wenches, out for their Fair Day
holiday, coming by at the same time; they had on
their best dresses and hats, and looked fresh and
nice. They turned round to watch him coming,
and half waited for him; when he came up he
checked his horse, and began to "cheek" them.
Nothing loth, the village girls "cheeked" him,
and so they passed on.</p>

<p>One or two very long men appeared, unusually
clumsy, even in walking they did not know exactly
what to do with their legs. Amaryllis had no
objection to their being tall&mdash;indeed, to be tall is
often a passport to a "Jewess' eye"&mdash;but they
were so clumsy.</p>

<p>Of the scores who went by in traps and vehicles
she could not see much but their clothes and their
faces, and both the clothes and the faces were very
much alike. Rough, good cloth, ill-fitting (the
shoulders were too broad for the tailor, who wanted
to force Bond Street measurements on the British
farmer's back); reddish, speckled faces, and yellowish
hair and whiskers; big speckled hands, and
that was all. Scores of men, precisely similar,
were driven down the road. If those broad speckled
hands had been shown to Jacob's ewes he need not
have peeled rods to make them bring forth speckled
lambs.</p>

<p>Against the stile a long way up the road there
was a group of five or six men, who were there<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
when she first peered over the wall, and made no
further progress to the Fair. They were waiting
till some acquaintance came by and offered a lift;
lazy dogs, they could not walk. They had already
been there long enough to have walked to the Fair
and back, still they preferred to fold their hands
and cross their legs, and stay on. So many people
being anxious to get to the town, most of those
who drove had picked up friends long before they
got here.</p>

<p>The worst walker of all was a constable, whose
huge boots seemed to take possession of the width
of the road, for he turned them out at right angles,
working his legs sideways to do it, an extraordinary
exhibition of stupidity and ugliness, for which the
authorities who drilled him in that way were responsible,
and not the poor fellow.</p>

<p>Among the lowing cattle and the baaing sheep
there drifted by a variety of human animals, tramps
and vagrants, not nearly of so much value as the
wool and beef.</p>

<p>It is curious that these "characters"&mdash;as they
are so kindly called&mdash;have a way of associating
themselves with things that promise vast enjoyment
to others. The number of unhappy, shirtless
wretches who thread their path in and out the
coaches at the Derby is wonderful. While the
champagne fizzes above on the roof, and the footman
between the shafts sits on an upturned hamper
and helps himself out of another to pie with truffles,
the hungry, lean kine of human life wander round<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
about sniffing and smelling, like Adam and Eve
after the fall at the edge of Paradise.</p>

<p>There are such incredible swarms of vagrants at
the Derby that you might think the race was got
up entirely for their sakes. There would be thousands
at Sandown, but the gate is locked with a
half-crown bolt, and they cannot get a stare at the
fashionables on the lawn. For all that, the true
tramp, male or female, is so inveterate an attendant
at races and all kinds of accessible entertainments
and public events that the features of the fashionable
are better known to him than to hundreds of
well-to-do people unable to enter society.</p>

<p>So they paddled along to the fair, slip-slop, in
the dust, among the cattle and sheep, hands in
pockets, head hanging down, most of them followed
at a short distance by a Thing.</p>

<p>This Thing is upright, and therefore, according
to the old definition, ought to come within the genus
Homo. It wears garments rudely resembling those
of a woman, and there it ends. Perhaps it was a
woman once; perhaps it never was, for many of
them have never had a chance to enter the ranks
of their own sex.</p>

<p>Amaryllis was too young, and, as a consequence,
too full of her own strength and youth and joy in
life to think for long or seriously about these curious
Things drifting by like cattle and sheep. Yet her
brow contracted, and she drew herself together as
they passed&mdash;a sort of shiver, to think that there
should be such degradation in the world. Twice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
when they came along her side of the road she
dropped pennies in front of them, which they picked
up in a listless way, just glancing over the ear in
the direction the money fell, and went on without
so much as recognizing where it came from.</p>

<p>If sheep were treated as unfortunate human
beings are, they would take a bitter revenge; though
they are the mildest of creatures, they would soon
turn round in a venomous manner. If they did
not receive sufficient to eat and drink, and were not
well sheltered, they would take a bitter revenge:
<i>they would die</i>. Loss of &pound; s. d.!</p>

<p>But human beings have not even got the courage
or energy to do that; they put up with anything,
and drag on&mdash;miserables that they are.</p>

<p>I said they were not equal in value to the sheep&mdash;why,
they're not worth anything when they're
dead. You cannot even sell the skins of the
Things!</p>

<p>Slip-slop in the dust they drive along to the
fair, where there will be an immense amount of
eating and a far larger amount of drinking all round
them, in every house they pass, and up to midnight.
They will see valuable animals, and men with well-lined
pockets. What on earth can a tramp find to
please him among all this? It is not for him; yet
he goes to see it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 121px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="121" height="120" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HE crowd began to pass more thickly,
when Amaryllis saw a man coming up
the road in the opposite direction to
that in which the multitude was moving.
They were going to the fair; he had
his back to it, and a party in a trap rallied him
smartly for his folly.</div>

<p>"What! bean't you a-going to fair? Why,
Measter Duck, what's up? Looking for a thunderstorm?"&mdash;which
young ducks are supposed to
enjoy. "Ha! ha! ha!"</p>

<p>Measter Duck, with a broad grin on his face,
nevertheless plodded up the hill, and passed beneath
Amaryllis.</p>

<p>She knew him very well, for he lived in the
hamlet, but she would not have taken any notice
of him had he not been so elaborately dressed.
His high silk hat shone glossy; his black broadcloth
coat was new and carefully brushed; he was
in black all over, in contrast with the mass of
people who had gone by that morning. A blue
necktie, bright and clean, spotless linen, gloves<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
rolled up in a ball in one hand, whiskers brushed,
boots shining, teeth clean, Johnny was off to the
fair!</p>

<p>The coat fitted him to a nicety; it had, in fact,
no chance to do otherwise, for his great back and
shoulders stretched it tight, and would have done
so had it been made like a sack. Of all the big
men who had gone by that day Jack Duck was the
biggest; his back was immense, and straight, too,
for he walked upright for a farmer, nor was his
bulk altogether without effect, for he was not over-burdened
with abdomen, so that it showed to the
best advantage. He was a little over the average
height, but not tall; he had grown laterally.</p>

<p>He could lift two sacks of wheat from the ground.
You just try to lift <i>one</i>.</p>

<p>His sleeves were too long, so that only the great
knuckles of his speckled hands were visible. Red
whiskers, red hair, blue eyes, speckled face, straight
lips, thick, like the edge of an earthenware pitcher,
and of much the same coarse red hue, always a
ready grin, a round, hard head, which you might have
hit safely with a mallet; and there is the picture.</p>

<p>For some reason, very big men do not look well
in glossy black coats and silk hats; they seem to
want wideawakes, bowlers, caps, anything rather
than a Paris hat, and some loose-cut jacket of a
free-and-easy colour, suitable for the field, or
cricket, or boating. They do not belong to the
town and narrow doorways; Nature grew them for
hills and fields.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>Compared with the Continental folk, most Englishmen
are big, and therefore, as their "best"
suits do not fit in with their character as written
in limbs and shoulders, the Continent thinks us
clumsy. The truth is, it is the Continent that is
little.</p>

<p>"Isn't he ugly?" thought Amaryllis, looking
down on poor John Duck. "Isn't he ugly?"
Now the top of the wall was crusted with moss,
which has a way of growing into bricks and mortar,
and attaching particles of brick to its roots. As
she watched the people she unconsciously trifled
with a little piece of moss&mdash;her hand happened at
the moment to project over the wall, and as John
Duck went under she dropped the bit of moss
straight on his glossy hat. Tap! the fragment of
brick adhering to the moss struck the hollow hat
smartly like a drum.</p>

<p>She drew back quickly, laughing and blushing,
and angry with herself all at the same time, for she
had done it without a thought.</p>

<p>Jack pulled off his hat, saw nothing, and put it
on again, suspecting that some one in a passing gig
had "chucked" something at him.</p>

<p>In a minute Amaryllis peeped over the wall,
and, seeing his broad back a long way up the road,
resumed her stand.</p>

<p>"How ever could I do such a stupid thing?"
she thought. "But isn't he ugly? Aren't they
<i>all</i> ugly? All of them&mdash;horridly ugly."</p>

<p>The entire unknown race of Man was hideous.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
So coarse in feature&mdash;their noses were thick, half
an inch thick, or enormously long and knobbed at
the end like a walking-stick, or curved like a
reaping-hook, or slewed to one side, or flat as if
they had been smashed, or short and stumpy and
incomplete, or spotted with red blotches, or turned
up in the vulgarest manner&mdash;nobody had a good
nose.</p>

<p>Their eyes were goggles, round and staring&mdash;like
liquid marbles&mdash;they had no eyelashes,
and their eyebrows were either white and invisible,
or shaggy, as if thistles grew along their
foreheads.</p>

<p>Their cheeks were speckled and freckled and red
and brick-dust and leather-coloured, and enclosed
with scrubby whiskers, like a garden hedge.</p>

<p>Upon the whole, those who shaved and were
smooth looked worse than those who did not, for
they thus exposed the angularities of their chins
and jaws.</p>

<p>They wore such horrid hats on the top of these
roughly-sketched faces&mdash;sketched, as it were, with
a bit of burnt stick. Some of them had their hats
on the backs of their heads, and some wore them
aslant, and some jammed over their brows.</p>

<p>They went along smoking and puffing, and talking
and guffawing in the vulgarest way, <i>en route</i> to
swill and smoke and puff and guffaw somewhere
else.</p>

<p>Whoever could tell what they were talking
about? these creatures.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>They had no form or grace like a woman&mdash;no
lovely sloped shoulders, no beautiful bosom, no
sweeping curve of robe down to the feet. No
softness of cheek, or silky hair, or complexion, or
taper fingers, or arched eyebrows; no sort of style
whatever. They were mere wooden figures; and,
in short, sublimely ugly.</p>

<p>There was a good deal of truth in Amaryllis'
reflections; it was a pity a woman was not taken
into confidence when the men were made.</p>

<p>Suppose the women were like the men, and we
had to make love to such a set of bristly, grisly
wretches!&mdash;pah! shouldn't we think them ugly!
The patience of the women, putting up with us so
long!</p>

<p>As for the muscles on which we pride ourselves
so much, in a woman's eyes (though she prefers a
strong man) they simply increase our extraordinary
ugliness.</p>

<p>But if we look pale, and slim, and so forth, then
they despise us, and there is no doubt that altogether
the men were made wrong.</p>

<p>"And Jack's the very ugliest of the lot,"
thought Amaryllis. "He just <i>is</i> ugly."</p>

<p>Pounding up the slope, big John Duck came
by-and-by to the gateway, and entering without
ceremony, as is the custom in the country, found
Mr. Iden near the back door talking to a farmer
who had seated himself on a stool.</p>

<p>He was a middle-aged man, stout and florid,
rough as a chunk of wood, but dressed in his best<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
brown for the fair. Tears were rolling down his
vast round cheeks as he expatiated on his grievances
to Mr. Iden:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Now, just you see how I be helped up with
this here 'ooman," he concluded as Duck arrived.
Mr. Iden, not a little glad of an opportunity to
escape a repetition of the narrative, to which he
had patiently listened, took Jack by the arm, and
led him indoors. As they went the man on the
stool extended his arm towards them hopelessly:&mdash;"Just
you see how I be helped up with this here
'ooman!"</p>

<p>A good many have been "helped up" with a
woman before now.</p>

<p>Mrs. Iden met Jack with a gracious smile&mdash;she
always did&mdash;yet there could not have been imagined
a man less likely to have pleased her.</p>

<p>A quick, nervous temperament, an eye sharp to
detect failings or foolishness, an admirer of briskness
and vivacity, why did she welcome John Duck,
that incarnation of stolidity and slowness, that
enormous mountain of a man? Because extremes
meet? No, since she was always complaining of
Iden's dull, motionless life; so it was not the contrast
to her own disposition that charmed her.</p>

<p>John Duck was Another Man&mdash;not Mr. Iden.</p>

<p>The best of matrons like to see Another Man
enter their houses; there's no viciousness in it, it
is simply nature, which requires variety. The best
of husbands likes to have another woman&mdash;or two,
or three&mdash;on a visit; there's nothing wrong, it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
innocent enough, and but gives a spice to the
monotony of existence.</p>

<p>Besides, John Duck, that mountain of slowness
and stolidity, was not perhaps a fool, notwithstanding
his outward clumsiness. A little attention is
appreciated even by a matron of middle age.</p>

<p>"Will you get us some ale?" said Iden; and
Mrs. Iden brought a full jug with her own hands&mdash;a
rare thing, for she hated the Goliath barrel as
Iden enjoyed it.</p>

<p>"Going to the fair, Mr. Duck?"</p>

<p>"Yes, m'm," said John, deep in his chest and
gruff, about as a horse might be expected to speak
if he had a voice. "You going, m'm? I just come
up to ask if you'd ride in my dog-trap?"</p>

<p>John had a first-rate turn-out.</p>

<p>Mrs. Iden, beaming with smiles, replied that she
was not going to the fair.</p>

<p>"Should be glad to take you, you know," said
John, dipping into the ale. "Shall you be going
presently?"&mdash;to Mr. Iden. "Perhaps you'd have
a seat?"</p>

<p>"Hum!" said Iden, fiddling with his chin, a
trick he had when undecided. "I don't zactly
know; fine day, you see; want to see that hedge
grubbed; want to fill up the gaps; want to go over
to the wood meads; thought about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, take and go!" said Mrs. Iden. "Sit
there thinking&mdash;take and go."</p>

<p>"I can't say zactly, John; don't seem to have
anything to go vor."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span></p>

<p>"What do other people go for?" said Mrs. Iden,
contemptuously. "Why can't you do like other
people? Get on your clean shirt, and go. Jack
can wait&mdash;he can talk to Amaryllis while you
dress."</p>

<p>"Perhaps Miss would like to go," suggested
John, very quietly, and as if it was no consequence
to him; the very thing he had called for, to see if
he could get Amaryllis to drive in with him. He
knew that Mrs. Iden never went anywhere, and
that Mr. Iden could not make up his mind in a
minute&mdash;he would require three or four days at
least&mdash;so that it was quite safe to ask them first.</p>

<p>"Of course she would," said Mrs. Iden. "She
is going&mdash;to dine with her grandfather; it will save
her a long walk. You had better go and ask
her; she's down at Plum Corner, watching the
people."</p>

<p>"So I wull," said Jack, looking out of the great
bow window at the mention of Plum Corner&mdash;he
could just see the flutter of Amaryllis' dress in the
distance between the trees. That part of the
garden was called Plum Corner because of a famous
plum tree&mdash;the one that had not been pruned and
was sprawling about the wall.</p>

<p>Mr. Iden had planted that plum tree specially for
Mrs. Iden, because she was so fond of a ripe
luscious plum. But of late years he had not
pruned it.</p>

<p>"Vine ale!" said John, finishing his mug.
"Extra vine ale!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"It be, bean't it?" said Mr. Iden.</p>

<p>It really was humming stuff, but John well knew
how proud Iden was of it, and how much he liked
to hear it praised.</p>

<p>The inhabitants of the City of London conceitedly
imagine that no one can be sharp-witted
outside the sound of Bow Bells&mdash;country people
are stupid. My opinion is that clumsy Jack Duck,
who took about half an hour to write his name, was
equal to most of them.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 121px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="121" height="120" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HE ale being ended, Iden walked with
him through the orchard.</div>

<p>"Famous wall that," said John, presently,
nodding towards the great red
brick wall which adorned that side of
the place. "Knowed how to build walls in those
days."</p>

<p>"No such wall as that anywhere about here,"
said Iden, as proud of his wall as his ale. "No
such bricks to be got. Folk don't know how to
put up a wall now&mdash;you read in the papers how the
houses valls down in Lunnon."</p>

<p>"Sort of cracks and comes in like&mdash;jest squashes
up," said John.</p>

<p>"Now, that's a real bit of brickwork," said Iden.
"That'll last&mdash;ah, last&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No end to it," said John, who had admired the
wall forty times before, thinking to himself as he
saw Amaryllis leaning over the corner, "Blessed if
I don't think as 'twas she as dropped summat on my
hat." This strengthened his hopes; he had a tolerably
clear idea that Mr. and Mrs. Iden were not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
averse to his suit; but he was doubtful about
Amaryllis herself.</p>

<p>Amaryllis had not the slightest idea Duck had
so much as looked at her&mdash;he called often, but
seemed absorbed in the ale and gossip. Fancy her
scorn if she had guessed!</p>

<p>John Duck was considered one of the most eligible
young men thereabouts, for though by no means
born in the purple of farming, it was believed he
was certain to be very "warm" indeed when his
father died. Old Duck, the son of a common
labourer, occupied two or three of the finest farms
in the neighbourhood. He made his money in a
waggon&mdash;a curious place, you will say; why so?
Have you ever seen the dingy, dark china-closets
they call offices in the City? Have you ever ascended
the dirty, unscrubbed, disgraceful staircase that leads
to a famous barrister's "chambers"? These are
far less desirable, surely, than a seat in a waggon
in a beautiful meadow or cornfield. Old Duck,
being too ponderous to walk, was driven about in a
waggon, sitting at the rear with his huge, short
legs dangling down; and, the waggon being halted
in a commanding position, he overlooked his men
at work.</p>

<p>One day he was put in a cart instead, and the
carter walking home beside the horse, and noting
what a pull it was for him up the hills, and drawling
along half asleep, quite forgot his master, and
dreamed he had a load of stones. By-and-by, he
pulled out the bar, and shot Old Duck out. "A<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
shot me out," grumbled the old man, "as if I'd a
been a load of flints."</p>

<p>Riding about in this rude chariot the old fellow
had amassed considerable wealth&mdash;his reputation
for money was very great indeed&mdash;and his son
John would, of course, come in for it.</p>

<p>John felt sure of Mr. and Mrs. Iden, but about
Amaryllis he did not know. The idea that she
had dropped "summat" on his hat raised his
spirits immensely.</p>

<p>Now Amaryllis was not yet beautiful&mdash;she was
too young; I do not think any girl is really
beautiful so young&mdash;she was highly individualized,
and had a distinct character, as it were, in her face
and figure. You saw at a glance that there was
something about her very different from other girls,
something very marked, but it was not beauty
yet.</p>

<p>Whether John thought her handsome, or saw
that she would be, or what, I do not know; or
whether he looked "forrard," as he would have
said.</p>

<div class='center'>
"Heigh for a lass with a tocher!"<br />
</div>

<p>John had never read Burns, and would not have
known that tocher meant dowry; nor had he seen
the advice of Tennyson&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Doesn't thee marry for money,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 0.5em;">But go where money lies."</span><br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>but his native intelligence needed no assistance
from the poets, coronetted or otherwise.</div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>

<p>It was patent to everyone that her father, Iden,
was as poor as the raggedest coat in Christendom
could make him; but it was equally well known and
a matter of public faith, that her grandfather, the
great miller and baker, Lord Lardy-Cake, as the
boys called him derisively, had literally bushels
upon bushels of money. He was a famous stickler
for ancient usages, and it was understood that there
were twenty thousand spade guineas in an iron
box under his bed. Any cottager in the whole
country side could have told you so, and would
have smiled at your ignorance; the thing was as
well known as that St. Paul's is in the City.</p>

<p>Besides which there was another consideration,
old Granfer Iden was a great favourite at Court&mdash;Court
meaning the mansion of the Hon. Raleigh
Pamment, the largest landowner that side of the
county. Granfer Iden entered the Deer Park
(which was private) with a special key whenever
he pleased, he strolled about the gardens, looked
in at the conservatory, chatted familiarly with the
royal family of Pamment when they were at home,
and when they were away took any friend he chose
through the galleries and saloons.</p>

<p>"Must be summat at the bottom on't," said
John Duck to himself many a time and oft. "They
stuck-up proud folk wouldn't have he there if there
wasn't summat at the bottom on't." A favourite
at Court could dispense, no doubt, many valuable
privileges.</p>

<p>Amaryllis heard their talk as they came nearer,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
and turned round and faced them. She wore a
black dress, but no hat; instead she had carelessly
thrown a scarlet shawl over her head, mantilla
fashion, and held it with one hand. Her dark
ringlets fringed her forehead, blown free and wild;
the fresh air had brought a bright colour into her
cheeks. As is often the case with girls whose
figure is just beginning to show itself, her dress
seemed somewhat shortened in front&mdash;lifted up
from her ankles, which gave the effect of buoyancy
to her form, she seemed about to walk though
standing still. There was a defiant light in her
deep brown eyes, that sort of "I don't care" disposition
which our grandmothers used to say
would take us to the gallows. Defiance, wilfulness,
rebellion, was expressed in the very way she stood
on the bank, a little higher than they were, and
able to look over their heads.</p>

<p>"Marning," said John, rocking his head to one
side as a salute.</p>

<p>"Marning," repeated Amaryllis, mocking his
broad pronunciation.</p>

<p>As John could not get any further Iden helped
him.</p>

<p>"Jack's going to the fair," he said, "and
thought you would like to ride with him. Run in
and dress."</p>

<p>"I shan't ride," said Amaryllis, "I shall walk."</p>

<p>"Longish way," said John. "Mor'n two mile."</p>

<p>"I shall walk," said Amaryllis, decidedly.</p>

<p>"Lot of cattle about," said John.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"Better ride," said Iden.</p>

<p>"No," said Amaryllis, and turned her back on
them to look over the wall again.</p>

<p>She was a despot already. There was nothing
left for them but to walk away.</p>

<p>"However," said Iden, always trying to round
things off and make square edges smooth, "very
likely you'll overtake her and pick her up."</p>

<p>"Her wull go across the fields," said John.
"Shan't see her."</p>

<p>As he walked down the road home for his dog-trap
he looked up at the corner of the wall, but she
was not looking over then. Mrs. Iden had fetched
her in, as it was time to dress.</p>

<p>"I don't want to go," said Amaryllis, "I hate
fairs&mdash;they are so silly."</p>

<p>"But you must go," said Mrs. Iden. "Your
grandfather sent a message last night; you know
it's his dinner-day."</p>

<p>"He's such a horrid old fellow," said Amaryllis,
"I can't bear him."</p>

<p>"How dare you speak of your grandfather like
that? you are getting very rude and disrespectful."</p>

<p>There was no depending on Mrs. Iden. At one
time she would go on and abuse Granfer Iden for
an hour at a time, calling him every name she could
think of, and accusing him of every folly under the
sun. At another time she would solemnly inform
Amaryllis that they had not a farthing of money,
and how necessary it was that they should be
attentive and civil to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Amaryllis very slowly put her hat on and the
first jacket to hand.</p>

<p>"What! aren't you going to change your
dress?"</p>

<p>"No, that I'm not."</p>

<p>"Change it directly."</p>

<p>"What, to go in and see that musty old&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Change it directly; I <i>will</i> be obeyed."</p>

<p>Amaryllis composedly did as she was bid.</p>

<p>One day Mrs. Iden humoured her every whim
and let her do just as she pleased; the next she
insisted on minute obedience.</p>

<p>"Make haste, you'll be late; now, then, put your
things on&mdash;come."</p>

<p>So Amaryllis, much against her will, was bustled
out of the house and started off. As John had
foreseen, she soon quitted the road to follow the
path across the fields, which was shorter.</p>

<p>An hour or so later Iden came in from work as
usual, a few minutes before dinner, and having
drawn his quart of ale, sat down to sip it in the
bow window till the dishes were brought.</p>

<p>"You're not gone, then?" said Mrs. Iden, irritatingly.</p>

<p>"Gone&mdash;wur?" said Iden, rather gruffly for
him.</p>

<p>"To fair, of course&mdash;like other people."</p>

<p>"Hum," growled Iden.</p>

<p>"You know your father expects all the family to
come in to dinner on fair day; I can't think how
you can neglect him, when you know we haven't got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
a shilling&mdash;why don't you go in and speak to
him?"</p>

<p>"You can go if you like."</p>

<p>"I go!" cried Mrs. Iden. "I go!" in shrill
accents of contempt. "I don't care a button for
all the lardy-cake lot! Let him keep his money.
I'm as good as he is any day. My family go about,
and do some business&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> family," muttered Iden. "The Flammas!"</p>

<p>"Yes, <i>my</i> family&mdash;as good as yours, I should
think! What's your family then, that you should
be so grand? You're descended from a lardy-cake!"</p>

<p>"You be descended from a quart pot," said
Iden.</p>

<p>This was an allusion to Mrs. Iden's grandfather,
who had kept a small wayside public.
There was no disgrace in it, for he was a very
respectable man, and laid the foundation of his
family's fortune, but it drove Mrs. Iden into
frenzy.</p>

<p>"You talk about a quart pot&mdash;<i>you</i>," she
shrieked. "Why, your family have drunk up thousands
of pounds&mdash;you know they have. Where's
the Manor? they swilled it away. Where's
Upper Court? they got it down their throats.
They built a house to drink in and nothing else.
You know they did. You told me yourself.
The most disgraceful set of drunkards that ever
lived!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Your family don't drink, then, I suppose?"
said Iden.</p>

<p>"Your lot's been drinking two hundred years&mdash;why,
you're always talking about it."</p>

<p>"Your family be as nervous as cats&mdash;see their
hands shake in the morning."</p>

<p>"They go to business in the City and do something;
they don't mess about planting rubbishing
potatoes." Mrs. Iden was London born.</p>

<p>"A pretty mess they've made of their business,
as shaky as their hands. Fidgetty, miserable,
nervous set they be."</p>

<p>"They're not stocks and stones like yours, anyhow,
as stolid, and slow, and stupid; why, you do
nothing but sleep, sleep, sleep, and talk, talk, talk.
You've been talking with the lazy lot over at the
stile, and you've been talking with that old fool at
the back door, and talking with Jack Duck&mdash;and
that's your second mug! You're descended from a
nasty, greasy lardy-cake! There!"</p>

<p>Iden snatched a piece of bread from the table and
thrust it in one pocket, flung open the oven-door,
and put a baked apple in the other pocket, and so
marched out to eat what he could in quiet under a
tree in the fields.</p>

<p>In the oratory of abuse there is no resource so
successful as raking up the weaknesses of the opponent's
family, especially when the parties are
married, for having gossiped with each other for
so long in the most confidential manner, they know
every foible. How Robert drank, and Tom bet,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
and Sam swore, and Bill knocked his wife about,
and Joseph did as Potiphar's spouse asked him, and
why your uncle had to take refuge in Spain; and
so on to an indefinite extent, like the multiplication
table.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 121px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="121" height="120" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HIS discordance between her father and
mother hurt Amaryllis' affectionate
heart exceedingly. It seemed to be
always breaking out all the year round.</div>

<p>Of a summer's eve, when the day's
work among the hot hay was done, Iden would
often go out and sit under the russet apple till the
dew had filled the grass like a green sea. When
the tide of the dew had risen he would take off his
heavy boots and stockings, and so walk about in
the cool shadows of eve, paddling in the wet grass.
He liked the refreshing coolness and the touch of the
sward. It was not for washing, because he was scrupulously
clean under the ragged old coat; it was
because he liked the grass. There was nothing
very terrible in it; men, and women, too, take off
their shoes and stockings, and wade about on the
sands at the sea, and no one thinks that it is anything
but natural, reasonable, and pleasant. But,
then, you see, <i>everybody</i> does it at the seaside, and
Iden alone waded in the dew, and that was his
crime&mdash;that he alone did it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>The storm and rage of Mrs. Iden whenever she
knew he was paddling in the grass was awful.
She would come shuffling out&mdash;she had a way of
rubbing her shoes along the ground when irritated
with her hands under her apron, which she twisted
about&mdash;and pelt him with scorn.</p>

<p>"There, put your boots on&mdash;do, and hide your
nasty feet!" (Iden had a particularly white skin, and
feet as white as a lady's.) "Disgusting! Nobody
ever does it but you, and you ought to be ashamed
of yourself! Anything more disgusting I never
heard of. Nobody else but you would ever think
of such a thing; makes me feel queer to see you."</p>

<p>Shuffling about, and muttering to herself, "Nobody
else"&mdash;that was the sin and guilt of it&mdash;by-and-by
Mrs. Iden would circle round to where he
had left his boots, and, suddenly seizing them,
would fling them in the ditch.</p>

<p>And I verily believe, in the depth of her indignation,
if she had not been afraid to touch firearms,
she would have brought out the gun, and had
a shot at him.</p>

<p>After a time Iden left his old post at the russet
apple, and went up the meadow to the horse-chestnut
trees that he himself had planted, and there, in
peace and quietness and soft cool shadow, waded
about in the dew, without any one to grumble at him.</p>

<p>How crookedly things are managed in this
world!</p>

<p>It is the modern fashion to laugh at the East,
and despise the Turks and all their ways, making<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
Grand Viziers of barbers, and setting waiters in
high places, with the utmost contempt for anything
reasonable&mdash;all so incongruous and chance-ruled.
In truth, all things in our very midst go on in the
Turkish manner; crooked men are set in straight
places, and straight people in crooked places, just
the same as if we had all been dropped promiscuously
out of a bag and shook down together on the earth
to work out our lives, quite irrespective of our
abilities and natures. Such an utter jumble!</p>

<p>Here was Iden, with his great brain and wonderful
power of observation, who ought to have
been a famous traveller in unexplored Africa or
Thibet, bringing home rarities and wonders; or,
with his singular capacity for construction, a leading
engineer, boring Mont Cenis Tunnels and making
Panama Canals; or, with his Baconian intellect,
forming a new school of philosophy&mdash;here was Iden,
tending cows, and sitting, as the old story goes,
undecidedly on a stile&mdash;sitting astride&mdash;eternally
sitting, and unable to make up his mind to get off
on one side or the other.</p>

<p>Here was Mrs. Iden, who had had a beautiful
shape and expressive eyes, full in her youth of life
and fire, who ought to have led the gayest life in
London and Paris alternately, riding in a carriage,
and flinging money about in the most extravagant,
joyous, and good-natured manner&mdash;here was Mrs.
Iden making butter in a dull farmhouse, and wearing
shoes out at the toes.</p>

<p>So our lives go on, rumble-jumble, like a carrier's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
cart over ruts and stones, thumping anyhow instead
of running smoothly on new-mown sward like a
cricket-ball.</p>

<p>It all happens in the Turkish manner.</p>

<p>Another time there would come a letter from one
of the Flammas in London. Could they spare a
little bag of lavender?&mdash;they grew such lovely
sweet lavender at Coombe Oaks. Then you might
see Mr. and Mrs. Iden cooing and billing, soft as
turtle-doves, and fraternising in the garden over
the lavender hedge. Here was another side, you
see, to the story.</p>

<p>Mrs. Iden was very fond of lavender, the scent,
and the plant in every form. She kept little bags
of it in all her drawers, and everything at Coombe
Oaks upstairs in the bedrooms had a faint, delicious
lavender perfume. There is nothing else that
smells so sweet and clean and dry. You cannot
imagine a damp sheet smelling of lavender.</p>

<p>Iden himself liked lavender, and used to rub it
between his finger and thumb in the garden, as he
did, too, with the black-currant leaves and walnut-leaves,
if he fancied anything he had touched
might have left an unpleasant odour adhering to
his skin. He said it cleaned his hands as much as
washing them.</p>

<p>Iden liked Mrs. Iden to like lavender because
his mother had been so fond of it, and all the sixteen
carved oak-presses which had been so familiar to him
in boyhood were full of a thick atmosphere of the
plant.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>Long since, while yet the honeymoon bouquet
remained in the wine of life, Iden had set a hedge
of lavender to please his wife. It was so carefully
chosen, and set, and watched, that it grew to be the
finest lavender in all the country. People used to
come for it from round about, quite certain of a
favourable reception, for there was nothing so sure
to bring peace at Coombe Oaks as a mention of
lavender.</p>

<p>But the letter from the Flammas was the great
event&mdash;from London, all that way, asking for some
Coombe Oaks lavender! Then there was billing
and cooing, and fraternising, and sunshine in the
garden over the hedge of lavender. If only it
could have lasted! Somehow, as people grow
older there seems so much grating of the wheels.</p>

<p>In time, long time, people's original feelings get
strangely confused and overlaid. The churchwardens
of the eighteenth century plastered the
fresco paintings of the fourteenth in their churches&mdash;covered
them over with yellowish mortar. The
mould grows up, and hides the capital of the fallen
column; the acanthus is hidden in earth. At the
foot of the oak, where it is oldest, the bark becomes
dense and thick, impenetrable, and without
sensitiveness; you may cut off an inch thick without
reaching the sap. A sort of scale or caking in
long, long time grows over original feelings.</p>

<p>There was no one in the world so affectionate
and loving as Mrs. Iden&mdash;no one who loved a father
so dearly; just as Amaryllis loved <i>her</i> father.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>But after they had lived at Coombe Oaks thirty
years or so, and the thick dull bark had grown,
after the scales or caking had come upon the heart,
after the capital of the column had fallen, after the
painting had been blurred, it came about that old
Flamma, Mrs. Iden's father, died in London.</p>

<p>After thirty years of absolute quiet at Coombe
Oaks, husband and wife went up to London to the
funeral, which took place at one of those fearful
London cemeteries that strike a chill at one's very
soul. Of all the horrible things in the world there
is nothing so calmly ghastly as a London cemetery.</p>

<p>In the evening, after the funeral, Mr. and Mrs.
Iden went to the theatre.</p>

<p>"How frivolous! How unfeeling!" No, nothing
of the sort; how truly sad and human, for to be
human is to be sad. That men and women should
be so warped and twisted by the pressure of the
years out of semblance to themselves; that circumstances
should so wall in their lives with insurmountable
cliffs of granite facts, compelling them
to tread the sunless gorge; that the coldness of
death alone could open the door to pleasure.</p>

<p>They sat at the theatre with grey hearts. With
the music and the song, the dancing, the colours
and gay dresses, it was sadder there than in the
silent rooms at the house where the dead had been.
Old Flamma alone had been dead <i>there</i>; they were
dead here. Dead in life&mdash;at the theatre.</p>

<p>They had used to go joyously to the theatre
thirty years before, when Iden came courting to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
town; from the edge of the grave they came back
to look on their own buried lives.</p>

<p>If you will only <i>think</i>, you will see it was a most
dreadful and miserable incident, that visit to the
theatre after the funeral.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/w.png" width="120" height="120" alt="W" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HEN Mrs. Iden threw his lardy-cake
descent in Iden's face she alluded to
Grandfather Iden's being a baker and
miller, and noted for the manufacture
of these articles. A lardy, or larded,
cake is a thing, I suppose, unknown to most of this
generation; they were the principal confectionery
familiar to country folk when Grandfather Iden was
at the top of his business activity, seventy years
since, in the Waterloo era.</div>

<p>A lardy-cake is an oblong, flat cake, crossed with
lines, and rounded at the corners, made of dough,
lard, sugar, and spice. Our ancestors liked something
to gnaw at, and did not go in for lightness in
their pastry; they liked something to stick to their
teeth, and after that to their ribs. The lardy-cake
eminently fulfilled these conditions; they put a
trifle of sugar and spice in it, to set it going as it
were, and the rest depended on the strength of the
digestion. But if a ploughboy could get a new,
warm lardy-cake, fresh from the oven, he thought
himself blessed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>Grandfather Iden had long since ceased any
serious business, but he still made a few of these
renowned cakes for his amusement, and sold a good
few at times to the carters' lads who came in to
market.</p>

<p>Amaryllis knew the path perfectly, but if she
had not, the tom-tomming of drums and blowing of
brass, audible two miles away, would have guided
her safely to the fair. The noise became prodigious
as she approached&mdash;the ceaseless tomtom, the beating
of drums and gongs outside the show vans, the
shouting of the showmen, the roar of a great
crowd, the booing of cattle, the baaing of sheep,
the neighing of horses&mdash;altogether the "rucket"
was tremendous.</p>

<p>She looked back from the hill close to the town
and saw the people hurrying in from every quarter&mdash;there
was a string of them following the path she
had come, and others getting over distant stiles. A
shower had fallen in the night, but the ceaseless
wheels had ground up the dust again, and the lines
of the various roads were distinctly marked by the
clouds hanging above them. For one on business,
fifty hastened on to join the uproar.</p>

<p>Suppose the Venus de Medici had been fetched
from Florence and had been set up in the town of
Woolhorton, or the Laocoon from Rome, or the
Milo from Paris, do you think all these people
would have scurried in such haste to admire these
beautiful works? Nothing of the sort; if you
want a crowd you must make a row. It is really<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
wonderful how people do thoroughly and unaffectedly
enjoy a fearful disturbance; if the cannon
could be shot off quietly, and guns made no noise,
battles would not be half so popular to read about.
The silent arrow is uninteresting, and if you describe
a medi&aelig;val scramble you must put in plenty
of splintering lances, resounding armour, shrieks
and groans, and so render it lively.</p>

<p>"This is the patent age of new inventions," and
some one might make a profit by starting a f&ecirc;te
announcing that a drum or a gong would be provided
for every individual, to be beaten in a grand
universal chorus.</p>

<p>Amaryllis had no little difficulty in getting
through the crowd till she found her way behind
the booths and slipped along the narrow passage
between them and the houses. There was an
arched entrance, arch&aelig;ologically interesting, by
which she paused a moment, half inclined to go up
and inquire for her boots. The shoemaker who
lived there had had them since Christmas, and all
that wanted doing was a patch on one toe; they
were always just going to be done, but never
finished. She read the inscription over his door,
"Tiras Wise, Shoemaker; Established 1697." A
different sort of shoemaker to your lively Northampton
awls; a man who has been in business two
hundred years cannot be hurried. She sighed, and
passed on.</p>

<p>The step to Grandfather Iden's door consisted
of one wide stone of semi-circular shape, in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
the feet of three generations of customers had
worn a deep grove. The venerable old gentleman,
for he was over ninety, was leaning on the hatch
(or lower half of the door), in the act of handing
some of his cakes to two village girls who had
called for them. These innocent, hamlet girls, supposed
to be so rurally simple, had just been telling
him how they never forgot his nice cakes, but always
came every fair day to buy some. For this they
got sixpence each, it being well known that the
old gentleman was so delighted with anybody who
bought his cakes he generally gave them back their
money, and a few coppers besides.</p>

<p>He took Amaryllis by the arm as she stood on
the step and pulled her into the shop, asked her if
her father were coming, then walked her down by
the oven-door, and made her stand up by a silver-mounted
peel, to see how tall she was. The peel
is the long wooden rod, broad at one end, with
which loaves are placed in the baker's oven. Father
Iden being proud of his trade, in his old age had
his favourite peel ornamented with silver.</p>

<p>"Too fast&mdash;too fast," he said, shaking his head,
and coughing; "you grow too fast; there's the
notch I cut last year, and now you're two inches
taller." He lowered the peel, and showed her
where his thumb was&mdash;quite two inches higher than
the last year's mark.</p>

<p>"I want to be tall," said Amaryllis.</p>

<p>"I daresay&mdash;I daresay," said the old man, in the
hasty manner of feeble age, as he cut another notch<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
to record her height. The handle of the peel was
notched all round, where he had measured his
grandchildren; there were so many marks it was
not easy to see how he distinguished them.</p>

<p>"Is your father coming?" he asked, when he
had finished with the knife.</p>

<p>"I don't know." This was Jesuitically true&mdash;she
did not <i>know</i>&mdash;she could not be certain; but in
her heart she was sure he would not come. But she
did not want to hear any hard words said about him.</p>

<p>"Has he sent anything? Have you brought
anything for me? No. No. Hum!&mdash;ha!"&mdash;fit
of coughing&mdash;"Well, well&mdash;come in; dinner's late,
there's time to hear you read&mdash;you're fond of books,
you read a great deal at home,"&mdash;and so talking,
half to himself and half to her, he led the way into
the parlour by the shop.</p>

<p>Bowed by more than ninety years, his back
curved over forwards, and his limbs curved in the
opposite direction, so that the outline of his form
resembled a flattened capital S. For his chin hung
over his chest, and his knees never straightened
themselves, but were always more or less bent as
he stood or walked. It was much the attitude of
a strong man heavily laden and unable to stand
upright&mdash;such an attitude as big Jack Duck in his
great strength might take when carrying two sacks
of wheat at once. There was as heavy a load on
Grandfather Iden's back, but Time is invisible.</p>

<p>He wore a grey suit, as a true miller and baker
should, and had worn the same cut and colour for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
years and years. In the shop, too, he always had
a grey hat on, perhaps its original hue was white,
but it got to appear grey upon him; a large grey
chimney-pot, many sizes too big for his head apparently,
for it looked as if for ever about to descend
and put out his face like an extinguisher.
Though his boots were so carefully polished, they
quickly took a grey tint from the flour dust as he
pottered about the bins in the morning. The ends
of his trousers, too long for his antique shanks,
folded and creased over his boots, and almost hid
his grey cloth under-gaiters.</p>

<p>A great knobbed old nose&mdash;but stay, I will not
go further, it is not right to paint too faithfully the
features of the very aged, which are repellent in
spite of themselves; I mean, they cannot help their
faces, their sentiments and actions are another
matter; therefore I will leave Father Iden's face
as a dim blot on the mirror; you look in it and it
reflects everywhere, except one spot.</p>

<p>Amaryllis followed him jauntily,&mdash;little did she
care, reckless girl, for the twenty thousand guineas
in the iron box under his bed.</p>

<p>The cottage folk, who always know so much, had
endless tales of Iden's wealth; how years ago
bushels upon bushels of pennies, done up in five-shilling
packets, had been literally carted like potatoes
away from the bakehouse to go to London; how
ponies were laden with sacks of silver groats, all
paid over that furrowed counter for the golden flour,
dust more golden than the sands of ancient Pactolus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>

<p>Reckless Amaryllis cared not a pin for all the
spade guineas in the iron box.</p>

<p>The old man sat down by the fire without removing
his hat, motioning to her to shut the door,
which she was loth to do, for the little room was
smothered with smoke. Troubled with asthma,
he coughed incessantly, and mopped his mouth
with a vast silk handkerchief, but his dull blood
craved for warmth, and he got his knees close to
the grate, and piled up the coal till it smoked and
smoked, and filled the close apartment with a
suffocating haze of carbon. To be asked into
Father Iden's sanctuary was an honour, but, like
other honours, it had to be paid for.</p>

<p>Amaryllis gasped as she sat down, and tried to
breathe as short as possible, to avoid inhaling more
than she could bear.</p>

<p>"Books," said her grandfather, pointing to the
bookcases, which occupied three sides of the room.
"Books&mdash;you like books; look at them&mdash;go and see."</p>

<p>To humour him, Amaryllis rose, and appeared to
look carefully along the shelves which she had
scanned so many times before. They contained
very good books indeed, such books as were not to
be found elsewhere throughout the whole town of
Woolhorton, and perhaps hardly in the county, old
and rare volumes of price, such as Sotheby, Wilkinson,
and Co. delight to offer to collectors, such as
Bernard Quaritch, that giant of the modern auction
room, would have written magnificent cheques for.</p>

<p>Did you ever see the Giant Quaritch in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
auction-room bidding for books? It is one of the
sights of London, let me tell you, to any one who
thinks or is alive to the present day. Most sights
are reputations merely&mdash;the pale reflection of things
that were real once. This sight is something of
the living time, the day in which we live. Get an
<i>Athen&aelig;um</i> in the season, examine the advertisements
of book auctions, and attend the next great
sale of some famous library.</p>

<p>You have a recollection of the giant who sat by
the highway and devoured the pilgrims who
passed? This giant sits in the middle of the ring
and devours the books set loose upon their travels
after the repose of centuries.</p>

<p>What prices to give! No one can withstand
him. From Paris they send agents with a million
francs at their back; from Berlin and Vienna come
the eager snappers-up of much considered trifles,
but in vain. They only get what the Giant chooses
to leave them.</p>

<p>Books that nobody ever heard of fetch &pound;50, &pound;60,
&pound;100, &pound;200; wretched little books never opened
since they were printed; dull duodecimos on the
course of the river Wein; nondescript indescribable
twaddling local books in Italian, Spanish, queer
French, written and printed in some unknown
foreign village; read them&mdash;you might as well try
to amuse yourself with a Chinese pamphlet! What
earthly value they are of cannot be discovered.
They were composed by authors whose names are
gone like the sand washed by the Nile into the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
sea before Herodotus. They contain no beautiful
poetry, no elevated thought, no scientific discovery;
they are simply so much paper, printing, and binding,
so many years old, and it is for that age,
printing, and binding that the money is paid.</p>

<p>I have read a good many books in my time&mdash;I
would not give sixpence for the whole lot.</p>

<p>They are not like a block-book&mdash;first efforts at
printing; nor like the first editions of great authors;
there is not the slightest intrinsic value in them
whatever.</p>

<p>Yet some of them fetch prices which not long
ago were thought tremendous even for the Shakespeare
folio.</p>

<p>Hundreds and hundreds of pounds are paid for
them. Living and writing authors of the present
day are paid in old songs by comparison.</p>

<p>Still, this enormous value set on old books is one
of the remarkable signs of the day. If any one
wishes to know what To-Day is, these book-auctions
are of the things he should go to see.</p>

<p>Such books as these lined Grandfather Iden's
shelves; among them there were a few that I call
<i>real</i> old books, an early translation or two, an early
Shakespeare, and once there had been a very
valuable Boccaccio, but this had gone into Lord
Pamment's library, "Presented by James Bartholomew
Iden, Esq."</p>

<p>The old man often went to look at and admire
his Boccaccio in my Lord's library.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 121px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="121" height="120" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HERE was one peculiarity in all the
books on Grandfather Iden's shelves,
they were all very finely bound in the
best style of hand-art, and they all bore
somewhere or other a little design of
an ancient Roman lamp.</div>

<p>Hand-art is a term I have invented for the workmanship
of good taste&mdash;it is not the sculptor's art,
nor the painter's&mdash;not the art of the mind, but the
art of the hand. Some furniture and cabinet work,
for instance, some pottery, book-binding like this,
are the products of hand-art.</p>

<p>"Do you see the Lamp?" asked the old man,
when Amaryllis had stared sufficiently at the backs
of the books.</p>

<p>"Yes, I can see the Lamp."</p>

<p>"House of Flamma," said old Iden.</p>

<p>"House of Flamma," repeated Amaryllis, hastily,
eager to show that she understood all about it. She
feared lest he should enter into the history of the
House of Flamma and of his connection with it;
she had heard it all over and over again; her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
mother was a Flamma; she had herself some of
the restless Flamma blood in her. When anything
annoyed her or made her indignant her foot used
to tap the floor, and her neck flush rosy, and her
face grow dusky like the night. Then, striving to
control herself, she would say to herself, "I <i>will</i> not
be a Flamma."</p>

<p>Except her dear mother and one other, Amaryllis
detested and despised the whole tribe of the Flammas,
the nervous, excitable, passionate, fidgetty,
tipsy, idle, good-for-nothing lot; she hated them
all, the very name and mention of them; she sided
with her father as an Iden against her mother's
family, the Flammas. True they were almost all
flecked with talent like white foam on a black horse,
a spot or two of genius, and the rest black guilt
or folly. She hated them; she would not be a
Flamma.</p>

<p>How should she at sixteen understand the wear
and tear of life, the pressure of circumstances, the
heavy weight of difficulties&mdash;there was something to
be said even for the miserable fidgetty Flammas,
but naturally sixteen judged by appearances. Shut
up in narrow grooves and working day after day,
year after year, in a contracted way, by degrees
their constitutional nervousness became the chief
characteristic of their existence. It was Intellect
overcome&mdash;over-burdened&mdash;with two generations of
petty cares; Genius dulled and damped till it went
to the quart pot.</p>

<p>Sixteen could scarcely understand this. Amaryllis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
detested the very name; she would not be a
Flamma.</p>

<p>But she was a Flamma for all that; a Flamma in
fire of spirit, in strength of indignation, in natural
capacity; she drew, for instance, with the greatest
ease in pencil or pen-and-ink, drew to the life; she
could write a letter in sketches.</p>

<p>Her indignation sometimes at the wrongfulness
of certain things seemed to fill her with a consuming
fire. Her partizanship for her father made her
sometimes inwardly rage for the lightning, that she
might utterly erase the opposer. Her contempt of
sycophancy, and bold independence led her constantly
into trouble.</p>

<p>Flamma means a flame.</p>

<p>Yet she was gentleness itself too; see her at the
bookshelves patiently endeavouring to please the
tiresome old man.</p>

<p>"Open that drawer," said he, as she came to it.</p>

<p>Amaryllis did so, and said that the coins and
medals in it were very interesting, as they really
were. The smoke caught her in the throat, and
seemed to stop the air as she breathed from reaching
her chest. So much accustomed to the open
air, she felt stifled.</p>

<p>Then he asked her to read to him aloud, that he
might hear how she enunciated her words. The
book he gave her was an early copy of Addison, the
page a pale yellow, the type old-fount, the edges
rough, but where in a trim modern volume will
you find language like his and ideas set forth with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
such transparent lucidity? How easy to write
like that!&mdash;so simple, merely a letter to an intimate
friend; but try!</p>

<p>Trim modern volumes are so very hard to read,
especially those that come to us from New York,
thick volumes of several hundred pages, printed on
the thinnest paper in hard, unpleasant type. You
cannot read them; you <i>work</i> through them.</p>

<p>The French have retained a little of the old style
of book in their paper bound franc novels, the rough
paper, thick black type, rough edges are pleasant
to touch and look at&mdash;they feel as if they were done
by hand, not turned out hurriedly smooth and trim
by machinery.</p>

<p>Docile to the last degree with him, Amaryllis
tried her utmost to read well, and she succeeded,
so far as the choking smoke would let her. By
grunting between his continuous fits of coughing
the old man signified his approval.</p>

<p>Amaryllis would have been respectful to any of
the aged, but she had a motive here; she wanted
to please him for her father's sake. For many
years there had been an increasing estrangement
between the younger and the elder Iden; an estrangement
which no one could have explained, for
it could hardly be due to money matters if Grandfather
Iden was really so rich. The son was his
father's tenant&mdash;the farm belonged to Grandfather
Iden&mdash;and perhaps the rent was not paid regularly.
Still that could not have much mattered&mdash;a mere
trifle to a man of old Iden's wealth. There was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
something behind, no one knew what; possibly they
scarcely knew themselves, for it is a fact that people
frequently fall into a quarrel without remembering
the beginning.</p>

<p>Amaryllis was very anxious to please the old
man for her father's sake; her dear father, whom
she loved so much. Tradesmen were for ever
worrying him for petty sums of money; it made
her furious with indignation to see and hear it.</p>

<p>So she read her very best, and swallowed the
choking smoke patiently.</p>

<p>Among the yellow pages, pressed flat, and still
as fresh as if gathered yesterday, Amaryllis found
bright petals and coloured autumn leaves. For it
was one of the old man's ways to carry home such
of these that pleased him and to place them in his
books. This he had done for half a century, and
many of the flower petals and leaves in the grey
old works of bygone authors had been there a
generation. It is wonderful how long they will
endure left undisturbed and pressed in this way;
the paper they used in old books seems to have
been softer, without the hard surface of our present
paper, more like blotting paper, and so keeps them
better. Before the repulsion between father and
son became so marked, Amaryllis had often been
with her grandfather in the garden and round the
meadows at Coombe Oaks, and seen him gather
the yellow tulips, the broad-petalled roses, and in
autumn the bright scarlet bramble leaves. The
brown leaves of the Spanish chestnut, too, pleased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
him; anything with richness of colour. The old
and grey, and withered man gathered the brightest
of petals for his old and grey, and forgotten books.</p>

<p>Now the sight of these leaves and petals between
the yellow pages softened her heart towards him;
he was a tyrant, but he was very, very old, they
were like flowers on a living tomb.</p>

<p>In a little while Grandfather Iden got up, and
going to a drawer in one of the bookcases, took from
it some scraps of memoranda; he thrust these between
her face and the book, and told her to read
them instead.</p>

<p>"These are your writing."</p>

<p>"Go on," said the old man, smiling, grunting,
and coughing, all at once.</p>

<p>"In 1840," read Amaryllis, "there were only
two houses in Black Jack Street." "Only <i>two</i>
houses!" she interposed, artfully.</p>

<p>"Two," said the grandfather.</p>

<p>"One in 1802," went on Amaryllis, "while in
1775 the site was covered with furze." "How it
has changed!" she said. He nodded, and coughed,
and smiled; his great grey hat rocked on his head
and seemed about to extinguish him.</p>

<p>"There's a note at the bottom in pencil, grandpa.
It says, 'A hundred voters in this street,
1884.'"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said the old man, an ah! so deep it fetched
his very heart up in coughing. When he finished,
Amaryllis read on&mdash;</p>

<p>"In 1802 there were only ten voters in the town."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah!" His excitement caused such violent
coughing Amaryllis became alarmed, but it did him
no harm. The more he coughed and choked the
livelier he seemed. The thought of politics roused
him like a trumpet&mdash;it went straight to his ancient
heart.</p>

<p>"Read that again," he said. "How many voters
now?"</p>

<p>"A hundred voters in this street, 1884."</p>

<p>"We've got them all"&mdash;coughing&mdash;"all in my
lord's houses, everyone; vote Conservative, one
and all. What is it?" as some one knocked.
Dinner was ready, to Amaryllis's relief.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would like to dine with me?"
asked the grandfather, shuffling up his papers.
"There&mdash;there," as she hesitated, "you would like
to dine with young people, of course&mdash;of course."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 119px;">
<img src="images/o.png" width="119" height="120" alt="O" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>LD Grandfather Iden always dined alone
in the parlour, with his housekeeper to
wait on him; they were just bringing
in his food. The family and visitors
had their meals in a separate and much
more comfortable apartment in another part of the
house, which was large. Sometimes, as a great
favour and special mark of approval, the old Pacha
would invite you to eat with him.</div>

<p>Amaryllis, though anxious to please him, hesitated,
not only because of the smoke, but because
she knew he always had pork for dinner.</p>

<p>The rich juices of roast pork sustained his dry
and withered frame&mdash;it was a sort of Burgundy of
flesh to him. As the good wine of Burgundy fills
the blood with iron and strengthens the body, so
the rich juice of the pork seemed to supply the oil
necessary to keep the sinews supple and to prevent
the cartilages from stiffening.</p>

<p>The scientific people say that it is the ossification
of the cartilages&mdash;the stiffening of the firmer
tissues&mdash;that in time interferes with the processes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
of life. The hinges rust, as if your tricycle had
been left out in the rain for a week&mdash;and the delicate
watchwork of the human frame will not run.</p>

<p>If suppleness could only be maintained there is
no reason why it should not continue to work for a
much longer period, for a hundred and fifty, two
hundred years&mdash;as long as you fancy. But nothing
has yet been devised to keep up the suppleness.</p>

<p>Grandfather Iden found the elixir of life in roast
pork. The jokers of Woolhorton&mdash;there are always
jokers, very clever they think themselves&mdash;considered
the reason it suited him so well was because
of the pig-like obstinacy of his disposition.</p>

<p>Anything more contrary to common sense than
for an old man of ninety to feed on pork it would
be hard to discover&mdash;so his friends said.</p>

<p>"Pork," said the physician, had down from London
to see him on one occasion, "pork is the first
on the list of indigestible articles of food. It takes
from six to eight hours for the gastric apparatus to
reduce its fibres. The stomach becomes overloaded&mdash;acidity
is the result; nightmares, pains, and innumerable
ills are the consequence. The very
worst thing Mr. Iden could eat."</p>

<p>"Hum," growled the family doctor, a native of
Woolhorton, when he heard of this. "Hum!"
low in his throat, like an irate bulldog. If in the
least excited, like most other country folk, he used
the provincial pronunciation. "Hum! A' have
lived twenty years on pork. Let'n yet it!"</p>

<p>Grandfather Iden intended to eat it, and did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
eat it six days out of seven, not, of course, roast
pork every dinner; sometimes boiled pork; sometimes
he baked it himself in the great oven. Now
and then he varied it with pig-meat&mdash;good old
country meat, let me tell you, pig-meat&mdash;such as
spare-rib, griskin, blade-bone, and that mysterious
morsel, the "mouse." The chine he always sent
over for Iden junior, who was a chine eater&mdash;a
true Homeric diner&mdash;and to make it even, Iden
junior sent in the best apples for sauce from his
favourite russet trees. It was about the only
amenity that survived between father and son.</p>

<p>The pig-meat used to be delicious in the old
house at home, before we all went astray along the
different paths of life; fresh from the pigs fed and
killed on the premises, nutty, and juicy to the
palate. Much of it is best done on a gridiron&mdash;here's
heresy! A gridiron is flat blasphemy to
the modern school of scientific cookery. Scientific
fiddlestick! Nothing like a gridiron to set your
lips watering.</p>

<p>But the "mouse,"&mdash;what was the "mouse?"
The London butchers can't tell me. It was a titbit.
I suppose it still exists in pigs; but London
folk are so ignorant.</p>

<p>Grandfather Iden ate pig in every shape and
form, that is, he mumbled the juice out of it, and
never complained of indigestion.</p>

<p>He was up at five o'clock every morning of his
life, pottering about the great oven with his baker's
man. In summer if it was fine he went out at six<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
for a walk in the Pines&mdash;the promenade of Woolhorton.</p>

<p>"If you wants to get well," old Dr. Butler used
to say, "you go for a walk in the marning afore
the aair have been braathed auver."</p>

<p>Before the air has been breathed over&mdash;inspired
and re-inspired by human crowds, while it retains
the sweetness of the morning, like water fresh
from the spring; that was when it possessed its
value, according to bluff, gruff, rule-of-thumb old
Butler. Depend upon it, there is something in his
dictum, too.</p>

<p>Amaryllis hesitated at the thought of the pork,
for he often had it underdone, so the old gentleman
dismissed her in his most gracious manner to dine
with the rest.</p>

<p>She went down the corridor and took the seat
placed for her. There was a posy of primroses
beside her napkin&mdash;posies of primroses all round
the table.</p>

<p>This raging old Tory of ninety years would give
a shilling for the earliest primrose the boys could
find for him in the woods. Some one got him
a peacock's feather which had fallen from Beaconsfield's
favourites&mdash;a real Beaconsfield peacock-feather&mdash;which
he had set in the centre of a splendid
screen of feathers that cost him twenty guineas.
The screen was upstairs in the great drawing-room
near a bow window which overlooked the fair.</p>

<p>People, you see, took pains to get him feathers
and anything he fancied, on account of the twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
thousand spade guineas in the iron box under the
bed.</p>

<p>His daughters, elderly, uninteresting married
folk, begged him not to keep a peacock's feather in
the house&mdash;it would certainly bring misfortune.
The superstition was so firmly rooted in their minds
that they actually argued with him&mdash;<i>argued</i> with
Grandfather Iden!&mdash;pointing out to him the fearful
risk he was running. He puffed and coughed, and
grew red in the face&mdash;the great grey hat shook
and tottered with anger; not for all the Powers of
Darkness would he have given up that feather.</p>

<p>The chairs round the large table were arranged
in accordance with the age of the occupants. There
were twenty-one grandchildren, and a number of
aunts, uncles, and so on; a vague crowd that does
not concern us. The eldest sat at the head of the
table, the next in age followed, and so all round
the dishes. This arrangement placed Amaryllis
rather low down&mdash;a long way from the top and
fountain of honour&mdash;and highly displeased her.
She despised and disliked the whole vague crowd
of her relations, yet being there, she felt that she
ought to have had a position above them all. Her
father&mdash;Iden, junior&mdash;was old Iden's only son and
natural heir; therefore her father's chair ought to
have been at the top of the table, and hers ought to
have been next to his.</p>

<p>Instead of which, as her father was not the
eldest, his seat was some distance from the top, and
hers again, was a long way from his.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>All the other chairs were full, but her father's
chair was empty.</p>

<p>The vague crowd were so immensely eager to
pay their despicable court to the Spade-Guinea
Man, not one of them stopped away; the old, the
young, the lame, the paralytic, all found means to
creep in to Grandfather Iden's annual dinner. His
only son and natural heir was alone absent. How
eagerly poor Amaryllis glanced from time to time
at that empty chair, hoping against hope that her
dear father would come in at the Psalms, or even at
the sermon, and disappoint the venomous, avaricious
hearts of the enemies around her.</p>

<p>For well she knew how delighted they were to
see his chair empty, as a visible sign and token of
the gulf between father and son, and well she knew
how diligently each laboured to deepen the misunderstanding
and set fuel to the flame of the quarrel.
If the son were disinherited, consider the enormous
profit to the rest of them!</p>

<p>Grandfather Iden made no secret of the fact that
he had not signed a will. It was believed that
several rough drafts had been sketched out for him,
but, in his own words&mdash;and he was no teller of
falsehoods&mdash;he had not decided on his will. If
only they could persuade him to make his will they
might feel safe of something; but suppose he went
off pop, all in a moment, as these extraordinarily
healthy old people are said to do, and the most of his
estate in land! Consider what a contingency&mdash;almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
all of it would go to his own son. Awful
thing!</p>

<p>Amaryllis was aware how they all stared at her
and quizzed her over and over; her hair, her face,
her form, but most of all her dress. They were so
poor at home she had not had a new dress this
twelvemonth past; it was true her dress was decent
and comfortable, and she really looked very nice in
it to any man's eye; but a girl does not want a
comfortable dress, she wants something in the style
of the day, and just sufficiently advanced to make
the women's eyes turn green with envy. It is not
the men's eyes; it is the women's eyes.</p>

<p>Amaryllis sat up very quiet and unconcerned,
trying with all her might to make them feel she was
the Heiress, not only an only son's only daughter,
but the only son's only offspring&mdash;doubly the
Heiress of Grandfather Iden.</p>

<p>The old folk, curious in such matters, had prophesied
so soon as she was born that there
would be no more children at Coombe Oaks, and so
it fell out. For it had been noticed in the course
of generations, that in the direct line of Iden when
the first child was a daughter there were none to
follow. And further, that there never was but one
Miss Iden at a time.</p>

<p>If the Direct Line had a daughter first, they
never had any more children; consequently that
daughter was the only Miss Iden.</p>

<p>If the Direct Line had a son, they never had a
second son, though they might have daughters;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
but then, in order that there should still be only one
Miss Iden, it always happened that the first died,
or was married early, before the second came into
existence.</p>

<p>Such was the tradition of the Iden family; they
had a long pedigree, the Idens, reaching farther
back than the genealogies of many a peer, and it
had been observed that this was the rule of their
descent.</p>

<p>Amaryllis was the only Miss Iden, and the heiress,
through her father, of the Spade-Guinea Man. She
tried to make them feel that she knew it and felt it;
that she was the Iden of the Idens. Her proud
face&mdash;it was a very proud face naturally&mdash;darkened
a little, and grew still more disdainful in its utter
scorn and loathing of the vague crowd of enemies.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 121px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="121" height="120" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>O one, as it were, in the gallery, it was
a delight to see her; her sweet cheeks,
fresh as the dawn, reddening with suppressed
indignation; her young brow
bent; her eyes cast down&mdash;don't you
think for a moment she would deign to look at them&mdash;pride
in her heart, and resolute determination to
fight for her dear father and mother.</div>

<p>But she felt as she sat so unconcerned that there
was a crack in her boot unmended, and it seemed
as if everyone could see it though under the solid
table. She had not had a really sound pair of
boots for many, many months; they could not
afford her a new pair at home, and the stupid shoemaker,
"Established 1697," was such a time repairing
her others.</p>

<p>She would not look at them, but she knew that
they were all dressed better than she was; there
were some of them very poor, and very vulgar, too,
but they were all dressed better than her, and
without a doubt had sound boots on their feet.</p>

<p>The cottagers in Coombe hamlet always had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
sound boots; she never had; nor, indeed, her
mother. Her father had a pair, being compelled
by the character of his work in the fields to take
care of himself so far, though he wore a ragged
coat. But neither mother nor daughter ever had
a whole pair of boots&mdash;whole and sound as the very
cottagers had.</p>

<p>If Amaryllis had sat there with naked feet she
would have been prouder than ever, and that is why
I always loved her so; she was not to be put down
by circumstances, she was above external things.</p>

<p>But as time went on, and the dinner was nearly
over&mdash;she had scarcely eaten anything&mdash;and as she
glanced from time to time at her father's empty
chair, and knew that he would not come, and that
his defection would revive the old quarrel which
might so easily have been mended, the Flamma
blood began to rise and grow hotter and hotter,
and the foot with the worn boot on it began to tap
the floor.</p>

<p>The Flamma blood would have liked to have
swept the whole company over a precipice into the
Red Sea as the herd of swine in old time. It was
either the Red Sea or somewhere; geography is of
no consequence.</p>

<div class='poem'>
Spain's an island near<br />
Morocco, betwixt Egypt and Tangier.<br />
</div>

<p>The Flamma blood would have liked to have
seen them all poisoned and dying on their seats.</p>

<p>The Flamma blood would have been glad to stick
a knife into each of them&mdash;only it would not have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
touched them with the longest hop-pole in Kent, so
utter was its loathing of the crew gloating over that
empty chair.</p>

<p>And for once Amaryllis did not check it, and did
not say to herself, "I <i>will</i> not be a Flamma."</p>

<p>Towards the end of the tedious banquet the word
was passed round that everyone was to sit still, as
Grandfather Iden was coming to look at his descendants.</p>

<p>There was not the least fear of any of them stirring,
for they well knew his custom&mdash;to walk round,
and speak a few words to everyone in turn, and to
put a new golden sovereign into their hands.
Thirty-two sovereigns it was in all&mdash;one for each&mdash;but
the thirty-third was always a spade-guinea,
which was presented to the individual who had best
pleased him during the year.</p>

<p>A genial sort of custom, no doubt, but fancy the
emulation and the heart-burning over the spade-guinea!
For the fortunate winner usually considered
himself the nearest to the Will.</p>

<p>Amaryllis' cheeks began to burn at the thought
that she should have to take his horrible money.
A hideous old monster he was to her at that moment&mdash;not
that he had done anything to her personally&mdash;but
he left her dear father to be worried
out of his life by petty tradesmen, and her dear
mother to go without a pair of decent boots, while
he made this pompous distribution among these
wretches. The hideous old monster!</p>

<p>Out in the town the boys behind his back gave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
him endless nicknames: Granfer Iden, Floury Iden,
My Lord Lardy-Cake, Marquis Iden, His Greasy
Grace; and, indeed, with his whims and humours,
and patronage, his caprices and ways of going on,
if he had but had a patent of nobility, Grandfather
Iden would have made a wonderfully good
duke.</p>

<p>By-and-by in comes the old Pacha, still wearing
his great grey tottery hat, and proceeds from chair
to chair, tapping folk on the shoulder, saying a
gracious word or two, and dropping his new golden
sovereigns in their eager palms. There was a loud
hum of conversation as he went round; they all
tried to appear so immensely happy to see him.</p>

<p>Amaryllis did not exactly watch him, but of
course knew what he was about, when suddenly
there was a dead silence. Thirty-two people suddenly
stopped talking as if the pneumatic <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'break'">brake</ins>
had been applied to their lips by a sixty-ton locomotive.</p>

<p>Dead, ominous silence. You could almost hear
the cat licking his paw under the table.</p>

<p>Amaryllis looked, and saw the old man leaning
with both hands on the back of his son's empty
chair.</p>

<p>He seemed to cling to it as if it was a spar
floating on the barren ocean of life and death into
which his withered old body was sinking.</p>

<p>Perhaps he really would have clung like that to
his son had but his son come to him, and borne a
little, and for a little while, with his ways.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span></p>

<p>A sorrowful thing to see&mdash;the old man of ninety
clinging to the back of his son's empty chair. His
great grey tottery hat seemed about to tumble on
the floor&mdash;his back bowed a little more&mdash;and he
groaned deeply, three times.</p>

<p>We can see, being out of the play and spectators
merely, that there was a human cry for help in the
old man's groan&mdash;his heart yearned for his son's
strong arm to lean on.</p>

<p>The crowd of relations were in doubt as to
whether they should rejoice, whether the groan was
a sign of indignation, of anger too deep ever to
be forgotten, or whether they should be alarmed at
the possibility of reconciliation.</p>

<p>The Flamma blood was up too much in Amaryllis
for her to feel pity for him as she would have
done in any other mood; she hated him all the
more; he was rich, the five-shilling fare was nothing
to him, he could hire a fly from the "Lamb Inn,"
and drive over and make friends with her father in
half an hour. Groaning there&mdash;the hideous old
monster! and her mother without a decent pair of
boots.</p>

<p>In a moment or two Grandfather Iden recovered
himself, and continued the distribution, and by-and-by
Amaryllis felt him approach her chair. She did
not even turn to look at him, so he took her hand,
and placed two coins in it, saying in his most
gracious way that the sovereign was for her father,
and the guinea&mdash;the spade-guinea&mdash;for herself.
She muttered something&mdash;she knew not what&mdash;she<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
could but just restrain herself from throwing the
money on the floor.</p>

<p>It was known in a moment that Amaryllis had
the guinea. Conceive the horror, the hatred, the
dread of the crowd of sycophants! That the
Heiress Apparent should be the favourite!</p>

<p>Yet more. Half-an-hour later, just after they
had all got upstairs into the great drawing-room,
and some were officiously and reverently admiring
the peacock-feather in the screen, and some looking
out of the bow window at the fair, there came a
message for Amaryllis to put on her hat and go for
a walk with her grandfather.</p>

<p>There was not one among all the crowd in the
drawing-room who had ever been invited to accompany
Iden Pacha.</p>

<p>Three days ago at home, if anyone had told
Amaryllis that she would be singled out in this
way, first to receive the Iden medal&mdash;the spade-guinea
stamp of approval&mdash;and then, above all
things, to be honoured by walking out with this
"almighty" grandfather, how delighted she would
have been at the thought of the triumph!</p>

<p>But now it was just the reverse. Triumph over
these people&mdash;pah! a triumph over rats and flies
or some such creatures. She actually felt lowered
in her own esteem by being noticed at all among
them. Honoured by this old horror&mdash;she revolted
at it. <i>He</i> honour her with his approval&mdash;she hated
him.</p>

<p>The other day a travelling piano was wheeled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
through Coombe and set up a tune in that lonesome
spot. Though it was but a mechanical piece
of music, with the cogs as it were of the mechanism
well marked by the thump, thump, it seemed to
cheer the place&mdash;till she went out to the gate to
look at the Italian woman who danced about while
the grinding was done, and saw that she had a
sound pair of boots on. That very morning her
mother in crossing the road had set the Flamma
rheumatism shooting in her bones, for the dampness
of the mud came through the crack in her boot.</p>

<p>This miserable old Iden Pacha thought to honour
her while he let her mother walk about with her
stocking on the wet ground!</p>

<p>The Flamma blood was up in her veins&mdash;what
did she care for guineas!</p>

<p>As she was putting her hat on in the bedroom
before the glass she looked round to see that no one
was watching, and then stooped down and put the
spade-guinea in the dust of the floor under the
dressing-table. She would have none of his hateful
money. The sovereign she took care of because it
was for her father, and he might buy something
useful with it; he wanted a few shillings badly
enough.</p>

<p>So the spade-guinea remained in the dust of the
floor for a week or two, till it pleased the housemaid
to move the dressing-table to brush away the accumulation,
when she found the shining one in the
fluff.</p>

<p>Being over thirty, she held her tongue, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
guinea henceforward travelled down the stream of
Time fast enough though silently, but she took the
first opportunity of examining the iron box under
the Pacha's bed, thinking perhaps there might be a
chink in it. And it was curious how for some time
afterwards a fit of extraordinary industry prevailed
in the house; there was not a table, a chair, or any
piece of furniture that was not chivvied about under
pretence of polishing. She actually had a day's
holiday and a cast-off gown given to her as a reward
for her labours.</p>

walked beside her grandfather slowly
up the street, or she would have seen
the company of relations watching them
from the bow-window.</div>

<p>Iden went straight through the crowd without
any hesitation on account of his age&mdash;angry as she
was, Amaryllis feared several times lest the clumsy
people should over-turn him, and tried her best to
shield him. But he had a knack of keeping on his
feet&mdash;the sort of knack you learn by skating&mdash;and did
not totter much more than usual, despite the press.</p>

<p>The world gets on with very little amusement
somehow. Here were two or three thousand people
packed in the street, and all they had to enliven
their festive gathering was the same old toys their
fathers' fathers' fathers had set before them.</p>

<p>Rows of booths for the display of "fairings,"
gingerbread, nuts, cakes, brandy-balls, and sugar-plums
stood in the gutter each side.</p>

<p>The "fairings" were sweet biscuits&mdash;they have
been made every fair this hundred years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>The nuts were dry and hard, just as Spanish nuts
always are. The gingerbread was moulded in the
same old shapes of clumsy horses outlined with gilt.</p>

<p>There was the same old trumpeting and tootling,
tom-tomming, and roaring of showmen's voices. The
same old roundabouts, only now they were driven
by steam, and short, quick whistles announced that
the whirligig caravan was travelling round the
world. The fat woman, the strong man, the
smashers tapping the "claret," the "Pelican of the
Wilderness," that mystic and melancholy bird, the
rifle galleries, the popping for nuts&mdash;behold these
are they our fathers have seen.</p>

<p>There is nothing new under the sun&mdash;not even
at Epsom. The first time I saw the wonderful
crowd of the Derby Day&mdash;perhaps the largest crowd
in the world&mdash;I could scarcely believe my eyes, for
I found on passing through it that the hundreds of
thousands of people there had nothing more to
amuse them than they would have found at an
ordinary country fair. Swings, roundabouts, cockshies
at cocoa-nuts, rootletum, tootletum, and beer.
That was all. No new amusement whatsoever: a
very humdrum sort of world, my masters!</p>

<p>The next finest crowd is the crowd on August
bank-holiday all along the Brighton beach, and
there it is just the same. Nothing for the folk
but Punch, brass bands, and somersaulters&mdash;dull
old stories in my grandmother's time.</p>

<p>Xerxes offered a reward to anyone who could
invent him a fresh pleasure&mdash;the multitude of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
Derby Day and Brighton beach should do the same.
But indeed they do, for an immense fortune would
certainly be the reward of such a discoverer. One gets
tired of pitching sticks at cocoa-nuts all one's time.</p>

<p>However, at Woolhorton nobody but the very
rawest and crudest folk cared for the shows, all they
did care was to alternately stand stock still and
then shove. First they shoved as far as the "Lion"
and had some beer, then they shoved back to the
"Lamb" and had some beer, then they stood stock
still in the street and blocked those who were shoving.
Several thousand people were thus happily
occupied, and the Lion and the Lamb laid down
together peacefully that day.</p>

<p>Amaryllis and old Iden had in like manner to
shove, for there was no other way to get through,
no one thought of moving, or giving any passage,
if you wanted to progress you must shoulder them
aside. As Grandfather Iden could not shove very
hard they were frequently compelled to wait till the
groups opened, and thus it happened that Amaryllis
found herself once face to face with Jack Duck.</p>

<p>He kind of sniggered in a foolish way at
Amaryllis, and touched his hat to Iden. "You
ain't a been over to Coombe lately, Mr. Iden," he
said.</p>

<p>"No," replied the old man sharply, and went on.</p>

<p>Jack could hardly have struck a note more discordant
to Amaryllis. The father had not been to
visit his son for more than a year&mdash;she did not
want unpleasant memories stirred up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span></p>

<p>Again in another group a sturdy labourer touched
his hat and asked her if her father was at fair, as
he was looking out for a job. Old Iden started
and grunted like a snorting horse.</p>

<p>Amaryllis, though put out, stayed to speak kindly
to him, for she knew he was always in difficulties.
Bill Nye was that contradiction a strong man without
work. He wanted to engage for mowing. Bill
Nye was a mower at Coombe, and his father, Bill
Nye, before him, many a long year before he was
discovered in California.</p>

<p>When she overtook Iden he was struggling to
pass the stream of the Orinoco, which set strongly
at that moment out of the "Lamb" towards the
"Lion." Strong men pushed out from the "Lamb"
archway like a river into the sea, thrusting their
way into the general crowd, and this mighty current
cast back the tottering figure of old Iden as the
swollen Orinoco swung the crank old Spanish caravels
that tried to breast it.</p>

<p>It was as much as Amaryllis and he together
could do to hold their ground at the edge of the
current. While they were thus battling she chanced
to look up.</p>

<p>A large window was open over the archway, and
at this window a fellow was staring down at her.
He stood in his shirt-sleeves with a billiard-cue in
his hand waiting his turn to play. It was the
same young fellow, gentleman if you like, whose
pale face had so displeased her that morning as he
rode under when she watched the folk go by to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
fair. He was certainly the most advanced in civilization
of all who had passed Plum Corner, and yet
there was something in that pale and rather delicate
face which was not in the coarse lineaments of the
"varmers" and "drauvers" and "pig-dealers"
who had gone by under the wall. Something that
insulted her.</p>

<p>The face at the window was appraising her.</p>

<p>It was reckoning her up&mdash;so much for eyes, so
much for hair, so much for figure, and as this went
on the fingers were filling a pipe from an elastic
tobacco-pouch. There was no romance, no poetry
in that calculation&mdash;no rapture or pure admiration
of beauty; there was a billiard-cue and a tobacco-pouch,
and a glass of spirits and water, and an
atmosphere of smoke, and a sound of clicking ivory
balls at the back of the thought. His thumb was
white where he had chalked it to make a better
bridge for the cue. His face was white; for he had
chalked it with dissipation. His physical body was
whitened&mdash;chalked&mdash;a whited sepulchre; his moral
nature likewise chalked.</p>

<p>At the back of his thought lay not the high
esteem of the poet-thinker for beauty, but the
cynical blackguardism of the XIXth century.</p>

<p>The cynicism that deliberately reckons up things
a Shakespeare would admire at their lowest possible
sale value. A slow whiff of smoke from a
corner of the sneering mouth, an air of intense
knowingness, as much as to say, "You may depend
upon me&mdash;I've been behind the scenes. All this is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
got up, you know; stage effect in front, pasteboard
at the rear; nothing in it."</p>

<p>In the sensuality of Nero there may still be found
some trace of a higher nature; "What an artist the
world has lost!" he exclaimed, dying.</p>

<p>The empress Theodora craved for the applause
of the theatre to which she exposed her beauty.</p>

<p>This low, cynical nineteenth century blackguardism
thinks of nothing but lowness, and has
no ideal. The milliner even has an ideal, she looks
to colour, shape, effect; though but in dress, yet it
is an ideal. There was no ideal in Ned Marks.</p>

<p>They called him from within to take his turn with
the cue; he did not answer, he was so absorbed in his
calculations. He was clever&mdash;in a way; he had
quite sufficient penetration to see that this was no
common girl. She was not beautiful&mdash;yet, she was
not even pretty, and so plainly dressed; still there
was something marked in her features. And she
was with old Iden.</p>

<p>Amaryllis did not understand the meaning of his
glance, but she felt that it was an insult. She looked
down quickly, seized her grandfather's arm, and
drew him out from the pavement into the street,
yielding a little to the current and so hoping to
presently pass it.</p>

<p>By this time, as Ned Marks did not answer, his
companions had come to the window to discover what
he was staring at. "Oho!" they laughed. "It's
Miss Iden. Twenty thousand guineas in the iron
box!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>

<p>Iden's great white hat, which always seemed to
sit loosely on his head, was knocked aside by the
elbow of a burly butcher struggling in the throng;
Amaryllis replaced it upright, and leading him this
way, and pushing him that, got at last to the opposite
pavement, and so behind the row of booths,
between them and the houses where there was less
crush. Taking care of him, she forgot to look to
her feet and stepped in the gutter where there was
a puddle. The cold water came through the crack
in her boot.</p>

<p>While these incidents were still further irritating
her, the old Pacha kept mumbling and muttering
to himself, nodding his head and smiling at each
fresh mark of attention, for though he was so independent
and fearless still he appreciated the trouble
she took. The mumbling in his mouth was a sort
of purring. Her dutiful spirit had stroked him up
to a pleasant state of electric glow; she felt like a
hound in a leash, ready to burst the bond that
held her to his hand. Side by side, and arm in arm,
neither of them understood the other; ninety and
sixteen, a strange couple in the jostling fair.</p>

<p>Iden turned down a passage near the end of the
street, and in an instant the roar of the crowd which
had boomed all round them was shut off by high
walls up which it rose and hummed over their heads
in the air. They walked on broad stone flags
notched here and there at the edges, for the rest
worn smooth by footsteps (the grave drives such a
trade) like Iden's doorstep, they were in fact tombstones,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
and the walled passage brought them to the
porch of the Abbey church.</p>

<p>There he stopped, muttering and mumbling, and
wiped his forehead with his vast silk handkerchief.
They were no longer incommoded by a crowd, but
now and then folk came by hastening to the fair;
lads with favours in their coats, and blue ribbons in
their hats, girls in bright dresses, chiefly crude
colours, who seemed out of accord with the heavy
weight as it were of the great Abbey, the ponderous
walls, the quiet gloom of the narrow space,
and the shadows that lurked behind the buttresses.</p>

<p>The aged man muttered and mumbled about the
porch and took Amaryllis under it, making her look
up at the groining, and note the spring of the arch,
which formed a sort of carved crown over them.
It was a fine old porch, deep and high, in some
things reminding you of the porches that are to be
seen in Spain; stone made to give a pleasant shade
like trees, so cut and worked as to be soft to the
eye.</p>

<p>He pointed out to her the touches that rendered
it so dear to those who value art in stone. He
knew them, every one, the history and the dates,
and the three stags' heads on a shield; there were
broad folios in the smoky room at home, filled
with every detail, Iden himself had subscribed forty
pounds to the cost of illustrating one of them.
Every scholar who visited the Abbey church, called
and begged to see the baker's old books.</p>

<p>Iden rubbed his old thumb in the grooves and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
went outside and hoisted himself, as it were, up from
his crooked S position to look at the three stags'
heads on the shield on the wall; dim stags' heads
that to you, or at least to me, might have been
fishes, or Jove's thunderbolts, or anything.</p>

<p>Amaryllis was left standing alone a moment in
the porch, the deep shadow within behind her, the
curve of the arch over, a fine setting for a portrait.
She stood the more upright because of the fire and
temper suppressed in her.</p>

<p>Just outside the human letter S&mdash;crooked S&mdash;clad
in sad white-grey miller's garments, its old hat
almost falling backwards off its old grey head,
gazed up and pointed with its oaken cudgel at the
coat of arms. Seven hundred years&mdash;the weight
of seven hundred years&mdash;hung over them both in
that old Abbey.</p>

<p>Into that Past he was soon to disappear: she
came out to the Future.</p>

<p>Thence he took her to an arched door, nail-studded,
in the passage wall, and giving her the key, told
her to open it, and stood watching her in triumph,
as if it had been the door to some immense treasury.
She turned the lock, and he pushed her before
him hastily, as if they must snatch so grand an
opportunity.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/w.png" width="120" height="120" alt="W" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>ITHIN there was a gravel path, and
glimpses between trees of wide pleasure-grounds.
Amaryllis hesitated, and
looked back; Iden drew her forward,
not noticing her evident disinclination
to proceed. If he had, he would have put it down
to awe, instead of which it was dislike.</div>

<p>For she guessed they were entering the lawns in
front of the Hon. Raleigh Pamment's mansion. He
was the largest owner of town and country; the
streets, the market-place, the open spaces, in which
the fair was being held, belonged to him; so did
most of the farms and hamlets out of which the
people had come. The Pamments were Tories;
very important Tories indeed.</p>

<p>The Idens, in their little way, were Tories, too,
right to the centre of the cerebellum; the Flammas
were hot Republicans. Now Amaryllis, being a
girl, naturally loved her father most, yet she was a
wilful and rebellious revolutionist. Amaryllis, who
would not be a Flamma, had imbibed all the
Flamma hatred of authority from her mother.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>To her the Pamments were the incarnation of
everything detestable, of oppression, obstruction,
and medi&aelig;val darkness. She knew nothing of
politics; at sixteen you do not need to know to
feel vehemently, you feel vehemently without knowing.
Still, she had heard a good deal about the
Pamments.</p>

<p>She resented being brought there to admire the
pleasure grounds and mansion, and to kow-tow to
the grandeur of these medi&aelig;val tyrants.</p>

<p>Old Iden led her on till they came to the smooth
lawn before the front windows; three centuries of
mowing had made it as smooth as the top of his
own head, where the years had mown away merrily.</p>

<p>There was not so much as a shrub&mdash;not a daisy&mdash;between
them and the great windows of the
house. They stood in full view.</p>

<p>Amaryllis could scarcely endure herself, so keen
was her vexation; her cheeks reddened. She was
obliged to face the house, but her glance was
downwards; she would not look at it.</p>

<p>Grandfather Iden was in the height of his glory.
In all Woolhorton town there was not another man
who could do as he was doing at that moment.</p>

<p>The Pamments were very exclusive people, exceptionally
exclusive even for high class Tories. Their
gardens, and lawns, and grounds were jealously
surrounded with walls higher than the old-fashioned
houses of the street beneath them. No one dared
to so much as peer through a crevice of the mighty
gates. Their persons were encircled with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
"divinity" that hedges the omnipotent landed
proprietor. No one dared speak to a Pamment.
They acknowledged no one in the town, not even
the solicitors, not even the clergyman of the Abbey
church; that was on account of ritual differences.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, whispered&mdash;high treason must
always be whispered&mdash;that young Pamment, the
son and heir, was by no means so exclusive, and
had been known to be effusive towards ladies of
low birth&mdash;and manners.</p>

<p>The great leaders of Greece&mdash;Alcibiades, Aristides,
and so on&mdash;threw open their orchards to the
people. Everyone walked in and did as he chose.
These great leaders of England&mdash;the Pamments&mdash;shut
up their lawns and pleasure-grounds, sealed
them hermetically, you could hardly throw a stone
over the walls if you tried.</p>

<p>But Grandfather Iden walked through those
walls as if there were none; he alone of all Woolhorton
town and country.</p>

<p>In that gossipy little town, of course, there
were endless surmises as to the why and wherefore
of that private key. Shrewd people said&mdash;"Ah!
you may depend they be getting summat out of
him. Lent 'em some of his guineas, a' reckon.
They be getting summat out of him. Hoss-leeches,
they gentlefolks."</p>

<p>Grandfather Iden alone entered when he listed:
he wandered about the lawns, he looked in at the
conservatories, he took a bunch of grapes if it
pleased him, or a bouquet of flowers; he actually<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
stepped indoors occasionally and sat down on the
carved old chairs, or pottered about the picture
gallery. He had a private key to the nail-studded
door in the wall by the Abbey church, and he
looked upon that key very much as if it had been
the key of Paradise.</p>

<p>When Grandfather Iden stood on the lawn at
Pamment House he was the proudest and happiest
man in what they sarcastically call "God's creation."</p>

<p>He was a peer at such moments; a grandee&mdash;the
grandee who can wear his hat or sit down
(which is it? it is most important to be accurate)
in the presence of his deity, I mean his sovereign;
he could actually step on the same sward pressed
by the holy toes of the Pamments.</p>

<p>In justice to him it must be said that he was
most careful not to obtrude himself into the sight
of their sacred majesties. If they were at home he
rarely went in, if he did he crept round unfrequented
paths, the byeways of the gardens, and hid himself
under the fig trees, as it were. But if by chance a
Pamment did light upon him, it was noteworthy
that he was literally dandled and fondled like an
infant, begged to come in, and take wine, and so
so, and so so.</p>

<p>In justice to old Iden let it be known that he
was most careful not to obtrude himself; he hid
himself under the fig trees.</p>

<p>Hardly credible is it? that a man of ninety years&mdash;a
man of no common intelligence&mdash;a man of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
books, and coins, and antiquities, should, in this
nineteenth century, bend his aged knees in such a
worship. Incredible as it may seem it is certainly
true.</p>

<p>Such loyalty in others of old time, remember,
seems very beautiful when we read of the devotion
that was shown towards Charles Stuart.</p>

<p>With all his heart and soul he worshipped the
very ground the Pamments trod on. He loved to
see them in the Abbey church; when they were at
home he never failed to attend service, rain, snow,
thunder, ninety years notwithstanding, he always
attended that he might bow his venerable head to
them as they swept up the aisle, receiving the
faintest, yet most gracious, smile of recognition in
return.</p>

<p>He was quite happy in his pew if he could see
them at their carved desks in the chancel; the
organ sounded very beautiful then; the light came
sweetly through the painted windows; a sanctity
and heavenly presence was diffused around.</p>

<p>Rebellious Amaryllis knew all this, and hated
it. Her Flamma foot tapped the sacred sward.</p>

<p>Grandfather Iden, after mopping his mouth with
his silk handkerchief, began to point with his
cudgel&mdash;a big hockey stick&mdash;at the various parts of
the building. This was Elizabethan, that dated
from James II., that went back to Henry VII.,
there were walls and foundations far more ancient
still, out of sight.</p>

<p>Really, it was a very interesting place arch&aelig;ologically,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
if only you could have got rid of the
Pamments.</p>

<p>Amaryllis made no remark during this mumbling
history. Iden thought she was listening intently.
At the conclusion he was just moving her&mdash;for she
was passive now, like a piece of furniture&mdash;when
he spied some one at a window.</p>

<p>Off came the great white hat, and down it swept
till the top brushed the grass in the depth of his
homage. It was a bow that would have delighted
a lady, so evidently real in its intent, so full of the
gentleman, so thoroughly courtier-like, and yet
honest. There was nothing to smile at in that
bow; there was not a young gentleman in Belgravia
who could bow in that way, for, in truth, we have
forgotten how to bow in this generation.</p>

<p>A writing and talking is always going on about
the high place woman occupies in modern society,
but the fact is, we have lost our reverence for
woman as woman; it is after-dinner speech, nothing
more, mere sham. We don't venerate woman,
and therefore we don't bow.</p>

<p>Grandfather Iden's bow would have won any
woman's heart had it been addressed to her, for
there was veneration and courtesy, breeding, and
desire to please in it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 121px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="121" height="120" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HE man he had seen at the window was
young Raleigh Pamment, the son and
heir.</div>

<p>He had been sitting in an easy chair,
one leg over the arm, busy with a
memorandum book, a stump of pencil, and a disordered
heap of telegrams, letters, and newspapers.</p>

<p>Everybody writes to Mr. Gladstone, a sort of
human lion's mouth for post-cards, but Raleigh
junior had not got to manage the House of Commons,
the revenue, the nation, the Turks, South
Africa, the Nile, Ganges, Indus, Afghanistan, sugar,
shipping, and Homer.</p>

<p>Yet Raleigh junior had an occasional table beside
him, from which the letters, telegrams, newspapers,
and scraps of paper had overflowed on to the floor.
In a company's offices it would have taken sixteen
clerks to answer that correspondence; this idle
young aristocrat answered it himself, entered it in
his day book, "totted" it up, and balanced the&mdash;the
residue.</p>

<p>Nothing at all businesslike, either, about him&mdash;nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
in the least like those gentlemen who consider
that to go in to the "office" every morning
is the sum total of life. A most unbusinesslike
young fellow.</p>

<p>A clay pipe in his mouth, a jar of tobacco on
another chair beside him, a glass of whiskey for a
paper-weight on his telegrams. An idle, lounging,
"bad lot;" late hours, tobacco, whiskey, and ballet-dancers
writ very large indeed on his broad face.
In short, a young "gent" of the latter half of the
nineteenth century.</p>

<p>Not the slightest sign of "blue blood" anywhere;
not even in the cut of his coat, no Brummel-like
elegance; hardly a Bond Street coat at all&mdash;rough,
large, coarse cloth. If he had stood at the
door of a shop he would have done very well indeed
for a shopkeeper, the sort that drives about in a
cart for orders.</p>

<p>Of his character nothing could be learned from
his features. His face was broad, rather flat, with
a short but prominent nose; in spite of indulgence,
he kept a good, healthy, country colour. His neck
was thick, his figure stout, his hands big&mdash;a jovial,
good-tempered looking man.</p>

<p>His neck was <i>very</i> thick, tree-like; a drover's
neck, no refinement or special intelligence indicated
there; great power to eat, drink, and sleep&mdash;belly
energy.</p>

<p>But let no one, therefore, suppose that the members
of the upper ten thousand are any thicker in
the neck, or more abdominal in their proclivities,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
or beneath the culture of the day. Take five
hundred "blue bloods," and you will find among
them a certain proportion of thick-necked people;
take five hundred very common commoners, and
you may count exactly the same number interspersed.</p>

<p>The Pamments were simply Englishmen, and liable
to be born big, with broad faces, thick necks, and
ultimate livers. It was no disgrace to Raleigh, that
jolly neck of his.</p>

<p>Unless you are given to &aelig;sthetic crockery, or
Francesco de Rimini, I think you would rather
have liked him; a sort of fellow who would lend
you his dogs, or his gun, or his horse, or his ballet-dancer,
or his credit&mdash;humph!&mdash;at a moment's
notice. But he was a very "bad lot;" they
whispered it even in dutiful Woolhorton.</p>

<p>He got rid of money in a most surprising way,
and naturally had nothing to show for it. The
wonderful manner in which coin will disappear in
London, like water into deep sand, surpasses the
mysteries of the skies. It slips, it slides, it glides,
it sinks, it flies, it runs out of the pocket. The
nimble squirrel is nothing to the way in which a
sovereign will leap forth in town.</p>

<p>Raleigh had a good allowance, often supplemented
by soft aunts, yet he frequently walked for lack of
a cab fare. <i>I</i> can't blame him; I should be just
as bad, if fortune favoured me. How delicious now
to walk down Regent Street, along Piccadilly, up
Bond Street, and so on, in a widening circle, with
a thousand pounds in one's pocket, just to spend,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
all your own, and no need to worry when it was
gone. To look in at all the shops and pick up
something here and something yonder, to say, "I'll
have that picture I admired ten years ago; I'll have
a bit of real old oak furniture; I'll go to Paris&mdash;"
but Paris is not a patch on London. To take a
lady&mdash;<i>the</i> lady&mdash;to St. Peter Robinson's, and spread
the silks of the earth before her feet, and see the
awakening delight in her eyes and the glow on her
cheek; to buy a pony for the "kids" and a diamond
brooch for the kind, middle-aged matron who befriended
you years since in time of financial need;
to get a new gun, and inquire about the price of a
deer-stalk in Scotland; whetting the road now
and then with a sip of Moet&mdash;but only one sip, for
your liver's sake&mdash;just to brighten up the imagination.
And so onwards in a widening circle, as
sun-lit fancy led: could Xerxes, could great Pompey,
could C&aelig;sar with all his legions, could Lucullus
with all his oysters, ever have enjoyed such pleasure
as this&mdash;just to spend money freely, with a jolly
chuckle, in the streets of London? What is
Mahomet's Paradise to <i>that</i>?</p>

<p>The exquisite delight of utterly abandoned extravagance,
no counting&mdash;anathemas on counting and
calculation! If life be not a dream, what is the
use of living?</p>

<p>Say what you will, the truth is, we all struggle
on in hope of living in a dream some day. This
is my dream. Dreadfully, horribly wicked, is it
not, in an age that preaches thrift and&mdash;twaddle?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
No joy like waste in London streets; happy
waste, imaginative extravagance; to and fro like a
butterfly!</p>

<p>Besides, there's no entertainment in the world
like the streets of London on a sunny day or a gas-lit
night. The shops, the carriages, the people, the
odds and ends of life one sees, the drifting to and
fro of folk, the "bits" of existence, glimpses into
shadowy corners, the dresses, the women; dear me,
where shall we get to? At all events, the fact
remains that to anyone with an eye the best entertainment
in the world is a lounge in London streets.
Theatres, concerts, s&eacute;ances, Albert Halls, museums,
galleries, are but set and formal shows; a great
weariness, for the most part, and who the deuce
would care to go and gaze at them again who could
lounge in Piccadilly?</p>

<p>It is well worth a ten-pound note any day in
May; fifty pounds sometimes at 1 p.m., merely to
look on, I mean, it is worth it; but you can see
this living show for nothing. Let the grandees go
to the opera; for me, the streets.</p>

<p>So I can't throw dirt at Raleigh, who often had
a hatful of money, and could and did just what
seemed pleasant in his sight. But the money went
like water, and in order to get further supplies, the
idle, good-for-nothing, lazy dog worked like a prime
minister with telegrams, letters, newspapers, and
so on, worked like a prime minister&mdash;at betting.
Horse-racing, in short, was the explanation of the
memorandum-book, the load of correspondence, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the telegrams, kept flat with a glass of whiskey as
a paper-weight.</p>

<p>While he wrote, and thought, and reckoned up
his chances, a loud refrain of snoring arose from
the sofa. It was almost as loud as the boom of
the fair, but Raleigh had no nerves. His friend
Freddie, becoming oppressed with so much labour,
had dropped asleep, leaving his whiskey beside him
on the sofa, so that the first time he moved over it
went on the carpet. With one long leg stretched
out, the other knee up, lying on his back, and his
mouth wide open to the ceiling, Freddie was very
happy.</p>

<p>Raleigh puffed his clay pipe, sipped, and puffed
again. Freddie boomed away on the sofa. The
family was in London; Raleigh and Freddie got
down here in this way: it happened one night there
was a row at a superb bar, Haymarket trail. The
"chuckers-out" began their coarse horse-play, and
in the general mel&eacute;e Raleigh distinguished himself.
Rolled about by the crowd, he chanced to find himself
for a moment in a favourable position, and
punished one of these gigantic brutes pretty
severely.</p>

<p>Though stout and short of breath, Raleigh was
strong in the arm, he was "up," and he hit hard.
The fellow's face was a "picture," coloured in
cardinal. Such an opportunity does not occur
twice in a lifetime; Raleigh's genius seized the
opportunity, and he became great. Actium was
a trifle to it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>

<p>There were mighty men before Agamemnon, and
there are mighty men who do not figure in the
papers.</p>

<p>Raleigh became at once an anaxandron&mdash;a King
of Men. The history of his feat spread in ten
minutes from one end of midnight London to the
other: from the policeman in Waterloo Place to&mdash;everywhere.
Never was such a stir; the fall of
Sebastopol&mdash;dear me! I can remember it, look at
the flight of time&mdash;was nothing to it. They would
have chaired him, <i>f&ecirc;ted</i> him, got a band to play him
about the place, literally crowned him with laurel.
Ave, C&aelig;sar! Ev&oelig;! Bacchus! But they could not
find him.</p>

<p>Raleigh was off with Freddie, who had been in
at the death, and was well "blooded." Hansom to
Paddington in the small hours; creep, creep, creep,
through the raw morning mist, puff, whistle, broad
gauge, and they had vanished.</p>

<p>Raleigh was a man of his age; he lost not a
moment; having got the glory, the next thing was
to elude the responsibility; and, in short, he slipped
out of sight till the hue-and-cry was over, and the
excitement of the campaign had subsided.</p>

<p>In case anyone should suppose I approve of midnight
battle, I may as well label the account at
once: "This is a goak."</p>

<p>I do <i>not</i> approve of brawls at the bar, but I have
set myself the task to describe a bit of human life
exactly as it really is, and I can assure you as a
honest fact that Raleigh by that lucky knock became<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
a very great man indeed among people as
they really are. People as they really are, are not
all Greek scholars.</p>

<p>As I don't wish you to look down upon poor
Raleigh too much because he smoked a cutty,
and hit a fellow twice as big as himself, and lent
his money, and made bets, and drank whiskey, and
was altogether wicked, I may as well tell you something
in his favour: He was a hero to his valet.</p>

<p>"No man is a hero to his valet," says the proverb,
not even Napoleon, Disraeli, or Solomon.</p>

<p>But Raleigh <i>was</i> a hero to his valet.</p>

<p>He was not only a hero to Nobbs the valet; he
had perfectly fascinated him. The instant he was off
duty Nobbs began to be a Raleigh to himself. He
put on a coat cut in the Raleigh careless style; in
fact, he dressed himself Raleigh all over. His
private hat was exactly like Raleigh's; so was his
necktie, the same colour, shape, and bought at the
same shop; so were his boots. He kept a sovereign
loose in his waistcoat pocket, because that
was where Raleigh carried his handy gold. He
smoked a cutty-pipe, and drank endless whiskies&mdash;just
like Raleigh, "the very ticket"&mdash;he had his
betting-book, and his telegrams, and his money on
"hosses," and his sporting paper, and his fine
photographs of fine women. He swore in Raleigh's
very words, and used to spit like him; Raleigh, if
ever he chanced to expectorate, had an odd way of
twisting up the corner of his mouth, so did Nobbs.
In town Nobbs went to the very same bars (always,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
of course, discreetly and out of sight), the very
same theatres; a most perfect Raleigh to the
tiniest detail. Why, Raleigh very rarely wound
up his watch&mdash;careless Raleigh; accordingly, Nobbs'
watch was seldom going. "And you just look
here," said Nobbs to a great and confidential friend,
after they had done endless whiskies, and smoked
handfuls of Raleigh's tobacco, "you look here, if I
was <i>he</i>, and had lots of chink, and soft old parties
to get money out of as easy as filling yer pipe, by
Jove! wouldn't <i>I</i> cut a swell! I'd do it, <i>I</i> would.
I'd make that Whitechapel of his spin along, I
rather guess I would. I'd liquor up. Wouldn't I
put a thou on the Middle Park Plate? Ah!
wouldn't I, Tommy, my boy! Just wouldn't I
have heaps of wimmen; some in the trap, and some
indoors, and some to go to the theatre with&mdash;respectable
gals, I mean&mdash;crowds of 'em would come
if Raleigh was to hold up his finger. Guess I'd
fill this old shop (the Pamment mansion) choke full
of wimmen! If I was only he! Shouldn't I like
to fetch one of them waiter chaps a swop on the
nose, like <i>he</i> did! Oh, my! Oh, Tommy!" And
Nobbs very nearly wept at the happy vision of being
"he."</p>

<p>Why, Raleigh was not only a Hero, he was a
Demi-god to his valet! Not only Nobbs, but the
footmen, and the grooms, and the whole race of
servants everywhere who had caught a glimpse of
Raleigh looked upon him as the Ideal Man. So
did the whole race of "cads" in the bars and at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
the races, and all over town and country, all of that
sort who knew anything of Raleigh sighed to be
like "he."</p>

<p>The fellow who said that "No man is a hero to
his valet" seemed to suppose that the world worships
good and divine qualities only. Nothing of
the sort; it is not the heroic, it is the low and
coarse and blackguard part the mass of people
regard with such deep admiration.</p>

<p>If only Nobbs could have been "he," no doubt
whatever he would have "done it" very big indeed.
But he would have left out of his copy that part of
Raleigh's nature which, in spite of the whiskey and
the cutty, and the rest of it, made him still a perfect
gentleman at heart. Nobbs didn't want to be a
perfect gentleman.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVII.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/g.png" width="120" height="120" alt="G" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>LANCING up from his betting-book,
Raleigh caught sight of someone on the
lawn, and went to the window to see
who it was.</div>

<p>It was then that Grandfather Iden
raised his great grey hat, and brought it with so
lowly a sweep down to the very ground before
this demi-god of his.</p>

<p>"Hullo! Fred, I say! Come, quick!" dragging
him off the sofa. "Here's the Behemoth."</p>

<p>"The Behemoth&mdash;the Deluge!" said Fred, incoherently,
still half asleep.</p>

<p>"Before that," said Raleigh. "I told you I'd
show him to you some day. That's the Behemoth."</p>

<p>Some grand folk keep a hump-backed cow, or
white wild cattle, or strange creatures of that sort,
in their parks as curiosities. The particular preserve
of the Pamments was Grandfather Iden&mdash;antediluvian
Iden&mdash;in short, the Behemoth.</p>

<p>It is not everybody who has got a Behemoth on
show.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's a girl with him," said Fred.</p>

<p>"Have her in," said Raleigh. "Wake us up,"
ringing the bell. And he ordered the butler to
fetch old Iden in.</p>

<p>How thoroughly in character with Human Life
it was that a man like Grandfather Iden&mdash;aged,
experienced, clever, learned, a man of wise old
books, should lower his ancient head, and do homage
to Raleigh Pamment!</p>

<div class='poem'>
"Wherefore come ye not to court?<br />
Skelton swears 'tis glorious sport.<br />
Chattering fools and wise men listening."<br />
</div>

<p>Accordingly the butler went out bare-headed&mdash;his
head was as bare as Mont Blanc&mdash;and, with
many a gracious smile, conveyed his master's wishes.
The Behemoth, mopping and mowing, wiping his
slobbery old mouth in the excess of his glorification,
takes Amaryllis by the arm, and proceeds to
draw her towards the mansion.</p>

<p>"But, grandpa&mdash;grandpa&mdash;really I'd rather not
go. Please, don't make me go. No&mdash;no&mdash;I can't,"
she cried, in a terror of disgust. She would not
willingly have set foot on the Pamment threshold,
no, not for a crown of gold, as the old song says
unctuously.</p>

<p>"Don't be afraid," said Iden. "Nothing to be
afraid of"&mdash;mistaking her hesitation for awe.</p>

<p>"Afraid!" repeated Amaryllis, in utter bewilderment.
"Afraid! I don't want to go."</p>

<p>"There's nothing to be afraid of, I'm sure," said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
the butler in his most insidious tones. "Mr. Pamment
so very particularly wished to see you."</p>

<p>"Come&mdash;come," said old Iden, "don't be silly,"
as she still hung back. "It's a splendid place
inside&mdash;there, lean on me, don't be afraid," and so
the grandfather pulling her one side, and the butler
very, very gently pressing her forward the other,
they persuaded, or rather they moved Amaryllis
onward.</p>

<p>She glanced back, her heart beat quick, she had
half a mind to break loose&mdash;easy enough to over-turn
the two old fogies&mdash;but&mdash;how soon "but"
comes, "but" came to Amaryllis at sixteen. She
remembered her father. She remembered her
mother's worn-out boots. By yielding yet a little
further she could perhaps contrive to keep her
grandfather in good humour and open the way to a
reconciliation.</p>

<p>So the revolutionary Amaryllis, the red-hot republican
blood seething like molten metal in her
veins, stepped across the hated threshold of the
ancient and medi&aelig;val Pamments.</p>

<p>But we have all heard about taking the horse to
water and finding that he would not drink. If you
cannot even make a horse, do you think you are
likely to <i>make</i> a woman do anything?</p>

<p>Amaryllis walked beside her grandfather quietly
enough now, but she would not see or hear; he
pointed out to her the old armour, the marble, the
old oak; he mumbled on of the staircase where
John Pamment, temp. Hen. VII., was seized for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
high treason; she kept her glance steadfastly on
the ground.</p>

<p>Iden construed it to be veneration, and was yet
more highly pleased.</p>

<p>Raleigh had taste enough to receive them in
another room, not the whiskey-room; he met old
Iden literally with open arms, taking both the old
gentleman's hands in his he shook them till Iden
tottered, and tears came into his eyes.</p>

<p>Amaryllis scarcely touched his fingers, and would
not raise her glance.</p>

<p>"Raw," thought Freddie, who being tall looked
over Raleigh's shoulder. "Very raw piece."</p>

<p>To some young gentlemen a girl is a "piece."</p>

<p>"My granddaughter," said Iden, getting his
voice.</p>

<p>"Ah, yes; like to see the galleries&mdash;fond of
pictures&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Amaryllis was silent.</p>

<p>"Answer," said Grandfather Iden graciously, as
much as to say, "you may."</p>

<p>"No," said Amaryllis.</p>

<p>"Hum&mdash;let's see&mdash;books&mdash;library&mdash;carvings.
Come, Mr. Iden, you know the place better than I
do, you're an antiquarian and a scholar&mdash;I've forgotten
my Greek. What would you like to show
her?"</p>

<p>"She <i>is</i> fond of pictures," said Iden, greatly
flattered that he should be thought to know the
house better than the heir. "She is fond of pictures;
she's shy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>Amaryllis' face became a dark red. The rushing
blood seemed to stifle her. She could have cried
out aloud; her pride only checked her utterance.</p>

<p>Raleigh, not noticing the deep colour in her
face, led on upstairs, down the corridors, and into
the first saloon. There he paused and old Iden
took the lead, going straight to a fine specimen of
an old Master.</p>

<p>Holding his great grey hat (which he would not
give up to the butler) at arm's-length and pointing,
the old man began to show Amaryllis the beauties
of the picture.</p>

<p>"A grand thing&mdash;look," said he.</p>

<p>"I can't see," said Amaryllis, forced to reply.</p>

<p>"Not see!" said Iden, in a doubtful tone.</p>

<p>"Not a good light, perhaps," said Raleigh.
"Come this side."</p>

<p>She did not move.</p>

<p>"Go that side," said Iden.</p>

<p>No movement.</p>

<p>"Go that side," he repeated, sharply.</p>

<p>At last she moved over by Raleigh and stood
there, gazing down still.</p>

<p>"Look up," said Iden. She looked up hastily&mdash;above
the canvas, and then again at the floor.</p>

<p>Iden's dim old eyes rested a moment on the pair
as they stood together; Amaryllis gazing downwards,
Raleigh gazing at her. Thoughts of a possible
alliance, perhaps, passed through Iden's mind;
only consider, intermarriage between the Pamments
and the Idens! Much more improbable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
things have happened; even without the marriage
license the connection would be an immense honour.</p>

<p>Grandfather Iden, aged ninety years, would most
certainly have sacrificed the girl of sixteen, his own
flesh and blood, joyously and intentionally to his
worship of the aristocrat.</p>

<p>If she could not have been the wife he would
have forced her to be the mistress.</p>

<p>There is no one so cruel&mdash;so utterly inhuman&mdash;as
an old man, to whom feeling, heart, hope have
long been dead words.</p>

<p>"Now you can see," he said, softly and kindly.
"Is it not noble?"</p>

<p>"It looks smoky," said Amaryllis, lifting her
large, dark eyes at last and looking her grandfather
in the face.</p>

<p>"Smoky!" he ejaculated, dropping his great
white hat, his sunken cheeks flushing. It was not
so much the remark as the tone of contemptuous
rebellion.</p>

<p>"Smoky," he repeated.</p>

<p>"Smoky and&mdash;dingy," said Amaryllis. She
had felt without actually seeing that Raleigh's gaze
had been fixed upon her the whole time since they
had entered, that emphatic look which so pleases or
so offends a woman.</p>

<p>Now there was nothing in Raleigh's manner to
give offence&mdash;on the contrary he had been singularly
pleasant, respectfully pleasant&mdash;but she remembered
the fellow staring at her from the window at the
"Lamb" and it biased her against him. She<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
wished to treat him, and his pictures, and his place
altogether with marked contempt.</p>

<p>"I do not care for these pictures," she said. "I
will leave now, if you please," and she moved towards
the door.</p>

<p>"Stop!" cried Iden, stretching out his hands
and tottering after her. "Stop! I order you to
stop! you rude girl!"</p>

<p>He could not catch her, she had left the gallery&mdash;he
slipped in his haste on the polished floor.
Fred caught him by the arm or he would have
fallen, and at the same time presented him with his
great white hat.</p>

<p>"Ungrateful!" he shrieked, and then choked
and slobbered and mumbled, and I verily believe had
it not been for his veneration of the place he would
have spat upon the floor.</p>

<p>Raleigh had rushed after Amaryllis, and overtook
her at the staircase.</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Miss Iden," he said, as she hastily
descended. "Really I should have liked you to
have seen the house&mdash;will you sit down a moment?
Forgive me if I said or did&mdash;&mdash;. No, do stay&mdash;please&mdash;"
as she made straight for the hall. "I
am so sorry&mdash;really sorry&mdash;unintentional"&mdash;in fact
he had done nothing, and yet he was penitent. But
she would not listen, she hurried on along the path,
she began to run, or nearly, as he kept up with her,
still begging her to pause; Amaryllis ran at last
outright. "At least let me see you through the fair&mdash;rough
people. Let me open the door&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>The iron-studded door in the wall shut with a
spring lock, and for a moment she could not unfasten
it; she tore at it and grazed her hand, the
blood started.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens!" cried Raleigh, now thoroughly
upset. "Let me bind it up," taking out his handkerchief.
"I would not have had this happen for
money"&mdash;short for any amount of money. "Let
me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Do please leave me," cried Amaryllis, panting,
not with the run, which was nothing to her, but
pent-up indignation, and still trying to open the
lock.</p>

<p>Raleigh pressed the lock and the door swung
open&mdash;he could easily have detained her there, but
he did not. "One moment, pray&mdash;Miss Iden."
She was gone down the passage between the Abbey
church and the wall; he followed, she darted out
into the crowd of the fair.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'>HEN he stopped and turned, angry beyond
measure, vexation biting deep
lines like aquafortis on his broad, good-natured
face.</div>

<p>"That I should have been such a
fool&mdash;an infernal blockheaded fool&mdash;" shutting the
iron-studded door with a kick and a clang&mdash;"muddle-headed
fool&mdash;I'll never touch a drop of
whiskey again&mdash;and that jackass, Fred&mdash;why, she's&mdash;"
a lady, he would have said, but did not dare
admit to himself now that he had thought to ask
her in to "wake us up." "But what did I do?
Can't think what annoyed her. Must have been
something between her and that tedious old Iden.
Quite sure I didn't do or say&mdash;&mdash;" but still he
could not quiet his conscience, for if he had not by
deed or word, he knew he had in thought.</p>

<p>He had sent for her as he might have done for
any of the vulgar wenches in the fair to amuse an
idle hour, and he was ashamed of himself.</p>

<p>In truth, Raleigh had never seen a woman like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
Amaryllis Iden. Her features were not beautiful,
as general ideas go, nor had her form the grace of
full increase; indeed words, and even a portrait by
a master-hand, would have failed to carry the impression
her nature had made upon him.</p>

<p>It is not the particular cast of features that
makes a man great, and gives him a pre-eminence
among his fellows. It is the character&mdash;the mind.</p>

<p>A great genius commands attention at once by
his presence, and so a woman may equally impress
by the power of her nature. Her moral strength
asserts itself in subtle ways.</p>

<p>I don't say for certain that it was her character
that impressed Raleigh&mdash;it might have been nothing
of the sort, it might have been <i>because it was
so</i>, a woman's reason, and therefore appropriate.
These things do not happen by "why and because."</p>

<p>Some may say it is quite out of place to suppose
a whiskey-sipping, cutty-pipe smoking, horse-racing,
bar-frequenting fellow like Raleigh could
by any possible means fall in love at first sight. But
whiskey, cutty, horse, and bar were not the real
man, any more than your hat is your head, they
were mere outside chaff, he had a sound heart all
the same, a great deal sounder and better, and infinitely
more generous than some very respectable
folk who are regularly seen in their pews, and grind
down their clerks and dependents to the edge of
starvation.</p>

<p>Raleigh was capable of a good deal of heart, such
as the pew-haunting Pharisee knows not of. Perhaps<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
he was not in love: at all events he was highly
excited.</p>

<p>Fred had contrived to keep old Iden from following
Amaryllis by representing that Raleigh would
be sure to bring her back. The butler, who was
very well acquainted with old Iden, hastily whipped
out a bottle of champagne and handed him a
brimming glass. The old gentleman, still mouthing
and bubbling over with rage, spluttered and drank,
and spluttered again, and refusing a second, would
go, and so met Raleigh in the hall.</p>

<p>Raleigh tried on his part to soothe the old man,
and on his part the old man tried at one and the
same moment to apologize for his granddaughter
and to abuse her for her misconduct. Consequently
neither of them heard or understood the other.</p>

<p>But no sooner was Iden gone than Raleigh, remembering
the rough crowd in the fair, despatched
the butler after him to see him safe home. It was
now growing dusky as the evening came on.</p>

<p>Without more ado, this young gentleman then
set to and swore at Fred for half an hour straight
ahead. Fred at first simply stared and wondered
what on earth had turned his brain; next, being
equally hot-tempered, he swore in reply; then there
followed some sharp recriminations (for each knew
too much of the other's goings on not to have
plenty of material), and finally they sparred. Two
or three cuffs cooled their ardour, having nothing
to quarrel about; sulks ensued; Raleigh buried
himself in the papers; Fred lit a cigar and walked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
out into the fair. Thus there was tribulation in the
great house of the Pamments.</p>

<p>Grandfather Iden permitted the butler to steer
him through the crowd quietly enough, because it
flattered him to be thus taken care of before the
world by a Pamment servitor. When they parted
at the doorstep he slipped half-a-sovereign in the
butler's hand&mdash;he could not offer less than gold to
a Pamments' man&mdash;but once inside, his demeanour
changed. He pushed away his housekeeper, went
into his especial sitting-room, bolted the door,
spread his hands and knees over the fire, and poked
the coals, grunted, poked, and stirred till smoke
and smuts filled the stuffy little place.</p>

<p>By-and-by there was a banging of drawers&mdash;the
drawers in the bureau and the bookcases were opened
and shut sharply&mdash;writing-paper was flung on the
table, and he sat down to write a letter with a
scratchy quill pen. The letter written was ordered
to post immediately, and the poking, and stirring,
and grunting recommenced. Thus there was tribulation
in the house of the head of the Idens.</p>

<p>Amaryllis meantime had got through the town
by keeping between the booths and the houses.
Just as she left the last street Ned Marks rode up&mdash;he
had been on the watch, thinking to talk with
her as she walked home, but just as he drew rein to
go slow and so speak, a heathen pig from the market
rushed between his horse's legs and spoiled the
game by throwing him headlong.</p>

<p>She did not see, or at least did not notice, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
hastening on, entered the fields. In coming to
town that morning she had seen everything; now,
returning in her anger and annoyance, she took no
heed of anything; she was so absorbed that when
a man&mdash;one of those she met going to the fair for
the evening&mdash;turned back and followed her some
way, she did not observe him. Finding that she
walked steadily on, the fellow soon ceased to pursue.</p>

<p>The gloom had settled when she reached home,
and the candles were lit. She gave her father the
sovereign, and was leaving the room, hoping to
escape questioning, when Mrs. Iden asked who had
the prize-guinea.</p>

<p>"I did," said Amaryllis, very quietly and reluctantly.</p>

<p>"Where is it? Why didn't you say so? Let me
see," said Mrs. Iden.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;I lost it," said Amaryllis.</p>

<p>"You lost it! Lost a guinea! A spade-guinea!"</p>

<p>"What!" said Iden in his sternest tones.
"Show it immediately."</p>

<p>"I can't; I lost it."</p>

<p>"Lost it!"</p>

<p>And they poured upon her a cross-fire of anger:
a careless, wasteful hussy, an idle wretch; what
did she do for her living that she could throw away
spade-guineas? what would her grandfather say?
how did she suppose they were to keep her, and she
not earn the value of a bonnet-string? time she
was apprenticed to a dressmaker; the quantity she
ate, and never could touch any fat&mdash;dear me, so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
fine&mdash;bacon was not good enough for her&mdash;she could
throw away spade-guineas.</p>

<p>Poor Amaryllis stood by the half-open door, her
hat in her hand, her bosom heaving, her lips apart
and pouting, not with indignation but sheer misery;
her head drooped, her form seemed to lose its firmness
and sink till she stooped; she could not face
them as she would have done others, because you
see she loved them, and she had done her best that
day till too sorely tried.</p>

<p>The storm raged on; finally Iden growled
"Better get out of sight." Then she went to her
bedroom, and sat on the bed; presently she lay
down, and sobbed silently on the pillow, after
which she fell asleep, quite worn out, dark circles
under her eyes. In the silence of the house, the
tom-tom and blare of brazen instruments blown at
the fair two miles away was audible.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/s.png" width="120" height="120" alt="S" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>o there was tribulation in three houses.
Next morning she scarcely dared come
in to breakfast, and opened the door
timidly, expecting heavy looks, and to
be snapped up if she spoke. Instead of which, on
taking her place, Iden carefully cut for her the
most delicate slice of ham he could find, and removed
the superfluous fat before putting it on her
plate. Mrs. Iden had a special jug of cream ready
for her&mdash;Amaryllis was fond of cream&mdash;and enriched
the tea with it generously.</div>

<p>"And what did you see at the fair?" asked
Iden in his kindest voice, lifting up his saucer&mdash;from
which he always drank&mdash;by putting his thumb
under it instead of over, so that his thick little
finger projected. He always sipped his tea in this
way.</p>

<p>"You had plenty of fun, didn't you?" said
Mrs. Iden, still more kindly.</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I don't know; I did not see much of the
fair," said Amaryllis, at a loss to understand the
change of manner.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>Iden smiled at his wife and nodded; Mrs. Iden
picked up a letter from the tea-tray and gave it to
her daughter:</p>

<p>"Read."</p>

<p>Amaryllis read&mdash;it was from Grandfather Iden,
furiously upbraiding Iden for neglecting his
daughter's education; she had no reverence, no
manners&mdash;an undutiful, vulgar girl; she had better
not show her face in his house again till she had
been taught to know her position; her conduct was
not fit for the kitchen; she had not the slightest
idea how to behave herself in the presence of persons
of quality.</p>

<p>She put it down before she had finished the
tirade of abuse; she did not look up, her face was
scarlet.</p>

<p>Iden laughed.</p>

<p>"Horrid old wretch! Served him right!" said
Mrs. Iden. "So glad you vexed him, dear!"</p>

<p>Amaryllis last night a wretch was this morning
a heroine. The grandfather's letter had done this.</p>

<p>Iden never complained&mdash;never mentioned his
father&mdash;but of course in his heart he bitterly felt
the harsh neglect shown towards him and his wife
and their child. He was a man who said the
less the more he was moved; he gossiped freely
with the men at the stile, or even with a hamlet
old woman. Not a word ever dropped from him
of his own difficulties&mdash;he kept his mind to himself.
His wife knew nothing of his intentions&mdash;he
was over-secretive, especially about money matters,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
in which he affected the most profound mystery,
as if everyone in Coombe was not perfectly aware
they could hardly get a pound of sugar on credit.</p>

<p>All the more bitterly he resented the manner
in which Grandfather Iden treated him, giving
away half-crowns, crown-pieces, shillings, and fourpenny
bits to anyone who would flatter his peculiarities,
leaving his own descendants to struggle
daily with debt and insult.</p>

<p>Iden was in reality a very proud man, and the
insults of his petty creditors fretted him.</p>

<p>He would have been glad if Amaryllis had become
her grandfather's favourite; as the grandfather had
thrown savage words at the girl, so much the more
was added to the score against the grandfather.</p>

<p>Mrs. Iden hated the grandfather with every drop
of Flamma blood in her veins&mdash;hated him above
all for his pseudo-Flamma relationship, for old Iden
had in his youth been connected with the Flammas
in business&mdash;hated him for his veneration of the
aristocratic and medi&aelig;val Pamments.</p>

<p>She was always impressing upon Amaryllis the
necessity of cultivating her grandfather's goodwill,
and always abusing him&mdash;contradicting herself in
the most natural manner.</p>

<p>This letter had given them such delight, because
it showed how deeply Amaryllis had annoyed the
old gentleman. Had he been whipped he could
hardly have yelled more; he screamed through his
scratchy quill. Suppose they did lose his money,
he had had <i>one</i> good upset, that was something.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>They were eager to hear all about it. Amaryllis
was at first very shy to tell, knowing that her
father was a thick Tory and an upholder of the
Pamments, and fearing his displeasure. But for
various reasons both father and mother grew warmer
in delight at every fresh incident of her story.</p>

<p>Mrs. Flamma Iden&mdash;revolutionary Flamma&mdash;detested
the Pamments enthusiastically, on principle
first, and next, because the grandfather paid them
such court.</p>

<p>Iden was indeed an extra thick Tory, quite opaque,
and had voted in the Pamment interest these thirty
years, yet he had his secret reasons for disliking
them personally.</p>

<p>Both Mr. and Mrs. Iden agreed in their scorn of
the grandfather's pottering about the grounds and
in and out the conservatories, as if that was the
highest honour on earth. Yet Mrs. Iden used
often to accuse her husband of a desire to do the
very same thing: "You're just as stupid," she
would say; "you'd think it wonderful to have a
private key&mdash;you're every bit as silly really, only
you haven't got the chance."</p>

<p>However, from a variety of causes they agreed in
looking on Amaryllis' disgrace as a high triumph
and glory.</p>

<p>So she was petted all the morning by both
parties&mdash;a rare thing&mdash;and in the afternoon Iden
gave her the sovereign she had brought home, to
buy her some new boots, and to spend the rest as
she chose on herself.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>Away went Amaryllis to the town, happy and yet
not without regret that she had increased the disagreement
between her father and grandfather.
She met the vans and gipsies slowly leaving the
site of the fair, the children running along with
bare brown feet. She went under the arch&aelig;ologically
interesting gateway, and knocked at the door
of Tiras Wise, shoemaker, "established 200 years."</p>

<p>Tiras Wise of the present generation was thin
and nervous, weary of the centuries, worn out, and
miserable-looking. Amaryllis, strong in the possession
of a golden sovereign, attacked him sharply
for his perfidious promises; her boots promised at
Christmas were not mended yet.</p>

<p>Tiras, twiddling a lady's boot in one hand, and
his foot measure in the other, very humbly and
deprecatingly excused himself; there had been so
much trouble with the workmen, some were so
tipsy, and some would not work; they were always
demanding higher wages, and just as he had a job
in hand going off and leaving it half finished&mdash;shoemaker's
tricks these. Sometimes, indeed, he could
not get a workman, and then there was the competition
of the ready-made boot from Northampton;
really, it was most trying&mdash;it really was.</p>

<p>"Well, and when am I going to have the boots?"
said Amaryllis, amused at the poor fellow's distress.
"When <i>are</i> they going to be finished?"</p>

<p>"You see, Miss Iden," said the shoemaker's
mother, coming to help her son, "the fact is, he's just
worried out of his life with his men&mdash;and really&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>"You don't seem to get on very well with your
shoemaking, Mr. Wise," said the customer, smiling.</p>

<p>"The fact is," said poor Wise, in his most melancholy
manner, with a deep sigh, "the fact is, the
men don't know their work as they used to, they
spoil the leather and cut it wrong, and leave jobs
half done, and they're always drinking; the leather
isn't so good as it used to be; the fact is," with a
still deeper sigh, "<i>we can't make a boot</i>."</p>

<p>At which Amaryllis laughed outright, to think
that people should have been in business two
hundred years as shoemakers, and yet could not
make a boot!</p>

<p>Her experience of life as yet was short, and she
saw things in their first aspect; it is not till much
later we observe that the longer people do one
thing, the worse they do it, till in the end they
cannot do it at all.</p>

<p>She presently selected a pair for herself, 9<i>s.</i>,
and another pair for her mother, 10<i>s.</i> 6<i>d.</i>, leaving
sixpence over; add sixpence discount for ready-money,
and she was still rich with a shilling.
Carrying the parcel, she went up the street and
passed old Iden's door on elate instep, happy that
she had not got to cross his threshold that day,
happy to think she had the boots for her mother.
Looking in at two or three dingy little shops, she
fixed at last on one, and bought half-a-dozen of the
very finest mild bloaters, of which Mrs. Iden was so
fond. This finished the savings, and she turned
quickly for home. The bloaters being merely bound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
round with one thin sheet of newspaper, soon imparted
their odour to her hand.</p>

<p>A lady whose hand smells of bloaters is not, I
hope, too ideal; I hope you will see now that I am
not imaginative, or given to the heroinesque.
Amaryllis, I can tell you, was quite absorbed in the
bloaters and the boots; a very sweet, true, and
loving hand it was, in spite of the bloaters&mdash;one to
kiss fervently.</p>

<p>They soon had the bloaters on over a clear fire
of wood-coals, and while they cooked the mother
tried her new boots, naturally not a little pleased
with the thoughtful present. The Flamma blood
surged with gratitude; she would have given her
girl the world at that moment. That she should
have remembered her mother showed such a good
disposition; there was no one like Amaryllis.</p>

<p>"Pah!" said Iden, just then entering, "pah!"
with a gasp; and holding his handkerchief to his
nose, he rushed out faster than he came in, for the
smell of bloaters was the pestilence to him.</p>

<p>They only laughed all the merrier over their
supper.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/r.png" width="120" height="118" alt="R" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>IGHT at the top of the house there
was a large, unfurnished room, which
Amaryllis had taken as her own long
since. It was her study, her thinking-room,
her private chapel and praying-room, her one
place of solitude, silence, and retirement.</div>

<p>The days had gone on, and it was near the end
of April. Coming up the dark stairs one morning,
she found them still darker, because she had just
left the sunshine. They were built very narrow,
as usual in old country-houses, and the landing
shut off with a door, so that when you were in them
you seemed to be in a box. There was no carpet&mdash;bare
boards; old-fashioned folk did not carpet
their stairs; no handrail; the edges of the steps
worm-eaten and ragged, little bits apt to break off
under sudden pressure, so that the board looked as
if it had been nibbled by mice.</p>

<p>Shutting the landing door behind her, Amaryllis
was in perfect darkness, but her feet knew the
well-remembered way, and she came quickly to
the top.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>There were two great rooms running the whole
length of the house: the first was a lumber-room,
the second her own especial cell. Cell-like it was,
in its monastic or conventual bareness. It was
vague with bareness: a huge, square room, gaunt
as a barn, the walls and ceiling whitewashed, the
floor plain boards. Yonder, near the one small
window, stood a table and tall-backed oaken chair,
afar off, as it were, from the doorway&mdash;a journey to
them across the creaking floor. On one side an
old four-post bedstead of dark oak, much damaged,
was placed by the wall; the sacking hung down in
a loop, torn and decayed&mdash;a bedstead on which no
one had slept these hundred years past. By the
table there was, too, an ancient carved linen-press
of black oak, Amaryllis' bookcase.</p>

<p>These bits of rude furniture were lost in the
vastness of space, as much as if you had thrown
your hat into the sky.</p>

<p>Amaryllis went straight to the window and knelt
down. She brought a handful of violets, fresh-gathered,
to place in the glass which she kept there
for her flowers. The window was cut in the thick
wall, and formed a niche, where she always had a
tumbler ready&mdash;a common glass tumbler, she could
not afford a vase.</p>

<p>They were the white wild violets, the sweetest of
all, gathered while the nightingale was singing his
morning song in the April sunshine&mdash;a song the
world never listens to, more delicious than his evening
notes, for the sunlight helps him, and the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
blue of the heavens, the green leaf, and the soft
wind&mdash;all the soul of spring.</p>

<p>White wild violets, a dewdrop as it were of
flower, tender and delicate, growing under the
great hawthorn hedge, by the mosses and among
the dry, brown leaves of last year, easily overlooked
unless you know exactly where to go for them.
She had a bunch for her neck, and a large bunch
for her niche. They would have sunk and fallen
into the glass, but she hung them by their chins
over the edge of the tumbler, with their stalks in
the water. Then she sat down in the old chair at
the table, and rested her head on her hand.</p>

<p>Except where she did this every day, and so
brushed it, a thin layer of dust had covered the
surface (there was no cloth) and had collected on
her portfolio, thrust aside and neglected. Dust on
the indiarubber, dust on the cake of Indian ink,
dust invisible on the smooth surface of the pencils,
dust in the little box of vine charcoal.</p>

<p>The hoarse baying of the hungry wolves around
the house had shaken the pencil from her fingers&mdash;Siberian
wolves they were, racing over the arid
deserts of debt, large and sharp-toothed, ever increasing
in number and ferocity, ready to tear the
very door down. There are no wolves like those
debt sends against a house.</p>

<p>Every knock at the door, every strange footstep
up the approach, every letter that came, was like
the gnawing and gnashing of savage teeth.</p>

<p>Iden could plant the potatoes and gossip at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
stile, and put the letters unopened on the mantelshelf&mdash;a
pile of bills over his head where he slept
calmly after dinner. Iden could plant potatoes,
and cut trusses of hay, and go through <i>his</i> work
to appearance unmoved.</p>

<p>Amaryllis could not draw&mdash;she could not do it;
her imagination refused to see the idea; the more
she concentrated her mind, the louder she heard the
ceaseless grinding and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>Potatoes can be planted and nails can be hammered,
bill-hooks can be wielded and faggots
chopped, no matter what the inward care. The
ploughman is deeply in debt, poor fellow, but he
can, and does, follow the plough, and finds, perhaps,
some solace in the dull monotony of his labour.
Clods cannot feel. A sensitive mind and vivid
imagination&mdash;a delicately-balanced organization,
that almost lives on its ideas as veritable food&mdash;cannot
do like this. The poet, the artist, the
author, the thinker, cannot follow their plough;
their work depends on a serene mind.</p>

<p>But experience proves that they <i>do</i> do their
work under such circumstances. They do; how
greatly then they must be tortured, or for what a
length of time they must have suffered to become
benumbed.</p>

<p>Amaryllis was young, and all her feelings unchecked
of Time. She could not sketch&mdash;that
was a thing of useless paper and pencil; what was
wanted was money. She could not read, that was
not real; what was wanted was solid coin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>So the portfolio was thrust aside, neglected and
covered with dust, but she came every day to her
flowers in the window-niche.</p>

<p>She had drawn up there in the bitter cold of
February and March, without a fire, disdainful of
ease in the fulness of her generous hope. Her
warm young blood cared nothing for the cold, if
only by enduring it she could assist those whom
she loved.</p>

<p>There were artists in the Flamma family in London
who made what seemed to her large incomes,
yet whose names had never been seen in a newspaper
criticism, and who had never even sent a
work to the Academy&mdash;never even tried to enter.
Their work was not of an ambitious order, but it
was well paid.</p>

<p>Amaryllis did not for a moment anticipate success
as an artist, nor think to take the world by storm
with her talent. Her one only hope was to get a
few pounds now and then&mdash;she would have sold
twenty sketches for ten shillings&mdash;to save her father
from insult, and to give her mother the mere necessities
of dress she needed.</p>

<p>No thought of possible triumph, nor was she
sustained by an overmastering love of art; she was
inspired by her heart, not her genius.</p>

<p>Had circumstances been different she would not
have earnestly practised drawing; naturally she
was a passive rather than an active artist.</p>

<p>She loved beauty for its own sake&mdash;she loved
the sunlight, the grass and trees, the gleaming<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
water, the colours of the fields and of the sky. To
listen to the running water was to her a dear delight,
to the wind in the high firs, or caught in the
wide-stretching arms of the oak; she rested among
these things, they were to her mind as sleep to the
body. The few good pictures she had seen pleased
her, but did not rouse the emotion the sunlight
caused; artificial music was enjoyable, but not like
the running stream. It said nothing&mdash;the stream
was full of thought.</p>

<p>No eager desire to paint like that or play like
that was awakened by pictures or music; Amaryllis
was a passive and not an active artist by nature.
And I think that is the better part; at least, I
know it is a thousand times more pleasure to me to
see a beautiful thing than to write about it. Could
I choose I would go on seeing beautiful things, and
not writing.</p>

<p>Amaryllis had no ambition whatever for name or
fame; to be silent in the sunshine was enough for
her. By chance she had inherited the Flamma
talent&mdash;she drew at once without effort or consideration;
it was not so much to her as it is to me
to write a letter.</p>

<p>The thought to make use of her power did not
occur to her until the preceding Christmas. Roast
beef and plum pudding were a bitter mockery at
Coombe Oaks&mdash;a sham and cold delusion, cold as
snow. A "merry Christmas"&mdash;holly berries,
mistletoe&mdash;and behind these&mdash;debt. Behind the
glowing fire, written in the flames&mdash;debt; in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
sound of the distant chimes&mdash;debt. Now be merry
over the plum-pudding while the wolves gnash their
teeth, wolves that the strongest bars cannot keep
out.</p>

<p>Immediately the sacred day was past they fell in
all their fury upon Iden. Pay me that thou

<h2>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/s.png" width="120" height="120" alt="S" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>O Amaryllis went up into the gaunt,
cold room at the top of the house, and
bent herself seriously to drawing.
There was no fireplace, and if there had
been they could not have allowed her
coals; coals were dear. It was quite an event
when the horse and cart went to the wharf for coal.
There was plenty of wood for the hearth&mdash;wood
grew on the farm&mdash;but coal was money.</div>

<p>The March winds howled round the corner of
the old thatched house, and now and again tremendous
rains blew up against the little western window
near which she had placed her table. Through
the silent cold of January, the moist cold of February,
the east winds and hurricane rains of March,
Amaryllis worked on in her garret, heedless of
nipped fingers and chilled feet.</p>

<p>Sometimes she looked out of the window and
watched Iden digging in the garden underneath,
planting his potatoes, pruning his trees and shrubs,
or farther away, yonder in the meadow, clearing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
out the furrows that the water might flow better&mdash;"trenching,"
as he called it.</p>

<p>The harder it rained the harder he worked at
this in the open, with a sack about his shoulders
like a cloak; the labourers were under shelter, the
master was out in the wet, hoping by guiding the
water to the grass to get a larger crop of hay in
June.</p>

<p>Bowed under his sack, with his rotten old hat,
he looked a woful figure as the heavy shower beat on
his back. But to Amaryllis he was always her
father.</p>

<p>Sometimes she went into the next room&mdash;the
lumber-room&mdash;only lighted by a window on a level
with the floor, a window which had no glass, but
only a wire network. Sitting on the floor there,
she could see him at the stile across the road, his
hands behind his back, gossiping now with another
farmer or two, now with a labourer, now with an
old woman carrying home a yoke of water from the
brook.</p>

<p>The gossiping hurt Amaryllis even more than
the work in the cold rain; it seemed so incongruous,
so out of character, so unlike the real Iden
as she knew him.</p>

<p>That he, with his great, broad and noble forehead,
and his profile like Shakespeare, should stand
there talk, talk, talking on the smallest hamlet
topics with old women, and labourers, and thickheaded
farmers, was to her a bewilderment and
annoyance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span></p>

<p>She could not understand it, and she resented it.
The real Iden she knew was the man of thought
and old English taste, who had told her so much
by the fireside of that very Shakespeare whom in
features he resembled, and of the poets from Elizabethan
days downwards. His knowledge seemed
to be endless; there was no great author he had not
read, no subject upon which he could not at least
tell her where to obtain information. Yet she knew
he had never had what is now called an education.
How clever he must be to know all these things!
You see she did not know how wonderful is the
gift of observation, which Iden possessed to a degree
that was itself genius. Nothing escaped him;
therefore his store was great.</p>

<p>No other garden was planted as Iden's garden
was, in the best of old English taste, with old English
flowers and plants, herbs and trees. In summer
time it was a glory to see: a place for a poet, a
spot for a painter, loved and resorted to by every
bird of the air. Of a bare old farmhouse he had
made a beautiful home.</p>

<p>Questions upon questions her opening mind had
poured upon him, and to all he had given her an
answer that was an explanation. About the earth
and about the sea, the rivers, and living things;
about the stars and sun, the comet, the wonders of
the firmament, of geology and astronomy, of science;
there was nothing he did not seem to know.</p>

<p>A man who had crossed the wide ocean as that
Ulysses of whom he read to her, and who, like that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
Ulysses, enjoyed immense physical strength, why
was he like this? Why was he so poor? Why
did he work in the rain under a sack? Why did
he gossip at the stile with the small-brained hamlet
idlers?</p>

<p>It puzzled her and hurt her at the same time.</p>

<p>I cannot explain why it was so, any better than
Amaryllis; I could give a hundred reasons, and
then there would be no explanation&mdash;say partly
circumstances, partly lack of a profession in which
talent would tell, partly an indecision of character&mdash;too
much thought&mdash;and, after all said and done,
Fate.</p>

<p>Watching him from the network window, Amaryllis
felt her heart drooping, she knew not why,
and went back to her drawing unstrung.</p>

<p>She worked very hard, and worked in vain.
The sketches all came back to her. Some of them
had a torn hole at the corner where they had been
carelessly filed, others a thumb-mark, others had
been folded wrongly, almost all smelt of tobacco.
Neither illustrated papers, periodicals: neither
editors nor publishers would have anything to do
with them. One or two took more care, and returned
the drawings quite clean; one sent a note
saying that they promised well.</p>

<p>Poor Amaryllis! They promised well, and she
wanted half a sovereign <i>now</i>. If a prophet assured
a man that the picture he could not now dispose of
would be worth a thousand pounds in fifty years,
what consolation would that be to him?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>They were all a total failure. So many letters
could not be received in that dull place without
others in the house seeing what was going on.
Once now and then Amaryllis heard a step on the
stairs&mdash;a shuffling, uncertain step&mdash;and her heart
began to beat quicker, for she knew it was her
mother. Somehow, although she loved her so
dearly, she felt that there was not much sympathy
between them. She did not understand her mother;
the mother did not understand the daughter.
Though she was working for her mother's sake,
when she heard her mother's step she was ashamed
of her work.</p>

<p>Mrs. Iden would come in and shuffle round the
room, drawing one foot along the floor in an aggravating
way she had, she was not lame, and look out
of window, and presently stand behind Amaryllis,
and say&mdash;</p>

<p>"Ah! you'll never do anything at that. Never
do anything. I've seen too much of it. Better
come down and warm yourself."</p>

<p>Now this annoyed Amaryllis so much because it
seemed so inconsistent. Mrs. Iden blew up her
husband for having no enterprise, and then turned
round and discouraged her daughter for being
enterprising, and this, too, although she was constantly
talking about the superiority of the art
employments of the Flammas in London to the
clodhopper work around her.</p>

<p>Amaryllis could never draw a line till her mother
had gone downstairs again, and then the words<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
kept repeating themselves in her ear&mdash;"Never do
no good at that, never do no good at that."</p>

<p>If we were to stay to analyse deeply, perhaps we
should find that Amaryllis was working for a mother
of her own imagination, and not for the mother of
fact.</p>

<p>Anyone who sits still, writing, drawing, or sewing,
feels the cold very much more than those who
are moving indoors or out. It was bitterly cold in
the gaunt garret, the more so because the wind
came unchecked through the wire network of the
window in the next room. But for that her
generous young heart cared nothing, nor for the
still colder wind of failure.</p>

<p>She had no name&mdash;no repute, therefore had her
drawings been equal to the finest ever produced
they would not have been accepted. Until the
accident of reputation arises genius is of no avail.</p>

<p>Except an author, or an artist, or a musician, who
on earth would attempt to win success by merit?
That alone proves how correct the world is in its
estimation of them; they must indeed be poor confiding
fools. Succeed by merit!</p>

<p>Does the butcher, or the baker, or the ironmonger,
or the tallow-chandler rely on personal
merit, or purely personal ability for making a business?
They rely on a little capital, credit, and much
push. The solicitor is first an articled clerk, and
works next as a subordinate, his "footing" costs
hundreds of pounds, and years of hard labour. The
doctor has to "walk the hospitals," and, if he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
can, he buys a practice. They do not rely on
merit.</p>

<p>The three fools&mdash;the author, the artist, and the
musician&mdash;put certain lines on a sheet of paper and
expect the world to at once admire their clever
ideas.</p>

<p>In the end&mdash;but how far is it to the end!&mdash;it is
true that genius is certain of recognition; the steed
by then has grown used to starvation, waiting for
the grass to grow. Look about you: Are the prosperous
men of business men of merit? are they all
clever? are they geniuses? They do not exactly
seem to be so.</p>

<p>Nothing so hard as to succeed by merit; no path
so full of disappointments; nothing so incredibly
impossible.</p>

<p>I would infinitely rather be a tallow-chandler,
with a good steady income and no thought, than an
author; at the first opportunity I mean to go into
the tallow business.</p>

<p>Until the accident of reputation chanced to come
to her, Amaryllis might work and work, and hope
and sigh, and sit benumbed in her garret, and
watch her father, Shakespeare Iden, clearing the
furrows in the rain, under his sack.</p>

<p>She had not even a diploma&mdash;a diploma, or a
certificate, a South Kensington certificate! Fancy,
without even a certificate! Misguided child!</p>

<p>What a hideous collection of frumpery they have
got there at the Museum, as many acres as Iden's
farm, shot over with all the rubbish of the "periods."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
What a mockery of true art feeling it is! They
have not even a single statue in the place. They
would shrivel up in horror at a nude model. <i>They</i>
teach art&mdash;miserable sham, their wretched art
culminates in a Christmas card.</p>

<p>Amaryllis had not even been through the South
Kensington "grind," and dared to send in original
drawings without a certificate. Ignorance, you
see, pure clodhopper ignorance.</p>

<p>Failure waited on her labours; the postman
brought them all back again.</p>

<p>Yet in her untaught simplicity she had chosen
the line which the very highest in the profession
would probably have advised her to take. She
drew what she knew. The great cart-horse, the old
barn up the road, the hollow tree, the dry reeds,
the birds, and chanticleer himself&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
High was his comb, and coral red withal,<br />
In dents embattled like a castle wall.<br />
</div>

<div class='unindent'>Hardly a circumstance of farm life she did not
sketch; the fogger with his broad knife cutting
hay; the ancient labourer sitting in the wheelbarrow
munching his bread-and-cheese, his face a
study for Teniers; the team coming home from
plough&mdash;winter scenes, most of them, because it
was winter time. There are those who would give
fifty pounds for one of those studies now, crumpled,
stained, and torn as they are.</div>

<p>It was a complete failure. Once only she had a
gleam of success. Iden picked up the sketch of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
the dry reeds in the brook, and after looking at it,
put it in his "Farmer's Calendar," on the mantelshelf.
Amaryllis felt like the young painter whose
work is at last hung at the Academy. His opinion
was everything to her. He valued her sketch.</p>

<p>Still, that was not money. The cold wind and
the chill of failure still entered her garret study.
But it was neither of these that at length caused
the portfolio to be neglected, she would have worked
on and on, hoping against hope, undaunted, despite
physical cold and moral check. It was the procession
of creditors.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/s.png" width="120" height="120" alt="S" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>TEADILY they came over from the town,
dunning Iden and distracting Amaryllis
in her garret. She heard the heavy footsteps
on the path to the door, the thump,
thump with the fist (there was neither
knocker nor bell, country fashion); more thumping,
and then her mother's excuses, so oft repeated, so
wearisome, so profitless. "But where is he?" the
creditor would persist. "He's up at the Hayes,"
or "He's gone to Green Hills." "Well, when will
he be in?" "Don't know." "But I wants to
know when this yer little account is going to be
settled." Then a long narration of his wrongs,
threats of "doing summat," i.e., summoning,
grumble, grumble, and so slow, unwilling steps
departing.</div>

<p>Very rude men came down from the villages
demanding payment in their rough way&mdash;a raw,
crude way, brutally insulting to a lady. Iden had
long since exhausted his credit in the town; neither
butcher, baker, draper, nor anyone else would let
them have a shilling's-worth until the shilling had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
been placed on the counter. He had been forced
lately to deal with the little men of the villages&mdash;the
little butcher who killed once a fortnight; the
petty cottagers' baker, and people of that kind.
Inferior meat and inferior bread on credit first;
coarse language and rudeness afterwards.</p>

<p>One day, the village baker, having got inside
the door as Mrs. Iden incautiously opened it, stood
there and argued with her, while Amaryllis in the
garret put down her trembling pencil to listen.</p>

<p>"Mr. Iden will send it up," said her mother.</p>

<p>"Oh, he'll send it up. When will he send it
up?"</p>

<p>"He'll send it up."</p>

<p>"He've a' said that every time, but it beant
come yet. You tell un I be come to vetch it."</p>

<p>"Mr. Iden's not in."</p>

<p>"I'll bide till he be in."</p>

<p>"He'll only tell you he'll send it up."</p>

<p>"I'll bide and see un. You've served I shameful.
It's nothing but cheating&mdash;that's what I calls
it&mdash;to have things and never pay for um. It's
cheating."</p>

<p>Amaryllis tore downstairs, flushed with passion.</p>

<p>"How dare you say such a thing? How dare
you insult my mother? Leave the house this
moment!"</p>

<p>And with both hands she literally pushed the
man, unwilling, but not absolutely resisting, outside,
grumbling as he moved that he never insulted
nobody, only asked for his money.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>A pleasing preparation this for steadiness of
hand, calculated to encourage the play of imagination!
She could do nothing for hours afterwards.</p>

<p>Just as often Iden was at home, and then it was
worse, because it lasted longer. First they talked
by the potato-patch almost under the window;
then they talked on the path; then they came
indoors, and then there were words and grumbling
sounds that rose up the staircase. By-and-by
they went out again and talked by the gate. At
last the creditor departed, and Iden returned indoors
to take a glass of ale and sit a moment till
the freshness of the annoyance had left his mind.
Mrs. Iden then had her turn at him: the old story&mdash;why
didn't he do something? Amaryllis knew
every word as well as if she had been sitting in the
room.</p>

<p>How Iden had patience with them Amaryllis
could not think; how he could stand, and be argued
with, and abused, and threatened, and yet not take
the persecutor by the collar and quietly put him in
the road, she could not understand.</p>

<p>The truth was he could not help himself; violence
would have availed nothing. But to youth it
seems as if a few blows are all that is needed to
overcome difficulties.</p>

<p>Waller and Co., the tailor&mdash;he was his own Co.&mdash;walked
over regularly once a week; very civil
and very persistent, and persistent in vain. How
he came to be a creditor was not easy to see, for
Iden's coat was a pattern of raggedness, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
trousers bare at the knee, and his shabby old hat
rotten. But somehow or other there was a five-pound
account two years overdue.</p>

<p>Cobb, the butcher at Woolhorton, got off his
trap as he went by, at least twice a week, to chivey
Iden about his money. Though he would not let
them have a mutton chop without payment, whenever
there was five shillings to spare for meat it
was always taken into his shop, as it was better to
have good meat there, if you had to pay cash
for meat, than inferior in the village. One day,
Amaryllis was waiting for some steak, side by side
with a poor woman, waiting for scraps, while
Cobb served a grand lady of the town. "Yes,
m'm&mdash;oh, yes, m'm, certainly, m'm," bows, and
scrapes, and washing of hands, all the obsequiousness
possible. When the fine lady had gone, "Lar,
Mr. Cobb," says the poor woman, "how different
you do speak to <i>they</i> to what you do speak to <i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," replied Cobb, not in the least abashed
at having one manner for the poor and another for
the rich. "Yes, you see, these ladies they require
such a deal of <i>homage</i>."</p>

<p>There was a long bill at Beavan's the grocer's,
but that was not much pressed, only a large blue
letter about once a month, as Beavan had a very
good profit out of them through the butter. Mrs.
Iden made excellent butter, which had a reputation,
and Beavan took it all at about half-price. If it had
been sold to anyone else he would have insisted on
payment. So, by parting with the best butter in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the county at half-price, they got their tea and
sugar without much dunning.</p>

<p>At one time Mrs. Iden became excited and
strange in her manner, as if on the point of hysterics,
from which Amaryllis divined something serious
was approaching, though her mother would say
nothing. So it turned out&mdash;a bailiff appeared, and
took up his quarters in the kitchen. He was very
civil and quiet; he sat by the great fire of logs, and
offered to help in any way he could. Iden gave
him plenty of beer, for one thing. Amaryllis could
not go into the kitchen&mdash;the dear old place seemed
deserted while he was there.</p>

<p>This woke up Iden for the moment. First there
was a rummaging about in his old bureau, and a
laborious writing of letters, or adding up of figures.
Next there was a great personal getting up, a bath,
clean linen, shaving, and donning of clothes packed
away these years past. In two hours or so Iden
came down another man, astonishingly changed,
quite a gentleman in every respect, and so handsome
in Amaryllis's eyes. Indeed, he was really
handsome still, and to her, of course, wonderfully so.
If only he would always dress like that!</p>

<p>Iden walked into Woolhorton, but all these preparations
had so consumed the time that the bank
was shut, the solicitor's offices closed, and there
was no means of raising any money that evening.
The son passed the father's doorstep&mdash;the worn
stone step, ground by the generations of customers&mdash;he
saw the light behind the blind in the little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
room where Grandfather Iden sat&mdash;he might, had
he paused and listened, have heard the old man
poke the fire, the twenty-thousand-guinea-man&mdash;the
son passed on, and continued his lonely walk
home, the home that held a bailiff.</p>

<p>A makeshift bed had to be made up for the bailiff
in the kitchen, and there he remained the night,
and was up and had lit the fire for Luce the servant
before she was down. The man was certainly very
civil, but still there was the shock of it.</p>

<p>Early in the morning Iden went into town again,
saw his solicitor, and got a cheque&mdash;it was only
five-and-twenty or thirty pounds, and the bailiff
left.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'>UT his presence did not die out of the
kitchen; they always seemed to feel as
if he had been there. The hearth had
been stained by a foreign foot, the very
poker had been touched by a foreign
hand, the rude form at the side by the wall had
been occupied by an intruder. Amaryllis had
always been so fond of the kitchen&mdash;the oldest part
of the house, two centuries at least. The wide
hearth and immense chimney, up which, when the
fire was out, of a winter's night you could see the
stars; over which of a windy night you could imagine
the witches riding by, borne on the deep
howling of the blast; the great beam and the gun
slung to it; the heavy oaken table, unpolished,
greyish oak; the window in the thick wall, set
with yellowish glass; the stone floor, and the walls
from which the whitewash peeled in flakes; the
rude old place was very dear to her.</div>

<p>Ofttimes they sat there in winter instead of the
sitting-room, drawn by its antique homeliness.
Mrs. Iden warmed elder wine, and Iden his great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
cup of Goliath ale, and they roasted chestnuts and
apples, while the potatoes&mdash;large potatoes&mdash;Iden's
selected specialities&mdash;were baking buried in the
ashes. Looking over her shoulder Amaryllis could
see the white drift of snow against the window,
which was on a level with the ground outside, and
so got Iden to tell her stories of the deep snow in
the United States, and the thick ice, sawn with
saws, or, his fancy roaming on, of the broad and
beautiful Hudson River, the river he had so admired
in his youth, the river the poets will sing some
day; or of his clinging aloft at night in the gale on
the banks of Newfoundland, for he had done duty
as a sailor. A bold and adventurous man in his
youth, why did he gossip at the stile now in his full
and prime of manhood?</p>

<p>It would be a long, long tale to tell, and even
then only those who have lived in the country and
had practical experience could fully comprehend
the hopelessness of working a small farm, unless you
are of a wholly sordid nature. Iden's nature was not
sordid; the very reverse. The beginning, or one
of the beginnings, of the quarrel between father
and son arose because of this; Grandfather Iden
could not forgive his son for making the place
beautiful with trees and flowers.</p>

<p>By-and-by the baked potatoes were done, and
they had supper on the old and clumsy table, village
made and unpolished, except in so far as the stains
of cooking operations had varnished it, the same
table at which "Jearje," the fogger, sat every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
morning to eat his breakfast, and every evening to
take his supper. What matter? George worked
hard and honestly all day, his great arms on the
table, spread abroad as he ate, did not injure it.</p>

<p>Great mealy potatoes, cracked open, white as the
snow without, floury and smoking; dabs of Mrs.
Iden's delicious butter, a little salt and pepper, and
there was a dish for a king. The very skins were
pleasant&mdash;just a taste.</p>

<p>They were not always alone at these kitchen-feasts,
sometimes a Flamma from London, sometimes
an Iden from over the hill, or others were
there. Iden was very hospitable&mdash;though most of
his guests (family connections) were idle folk, no
good to themselves or anybody, still they were
made cordially welcome. But others, very high
folk, socially speaking (for they had good connections,
too, these poor Idens), who had dined at
grand London tables, seemed to enjoy themselves
most thoroughly on the rude Homeric fare.</p>

<p>For it was genuine, and there was a breadth, an
open-handed generosity, a sense of reality about it;
something really to eat, though no finger-glasses;
Homeric straightforwardness of purpose.</p>

<p>Amaryllis was very fond of the old kitchen; it
was the very centre of home. This strange man,
this intruding bailiff, trod heavily on her dearest
emotions. His shadow remained on the wall
though he had gone.</p>

<p>They all felt it, but Amaryllis most of all, and it
was weeks before the kitchen seemed to resume its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
former appearance. Jearje was the one who restored
it. He ate so heartily, and spoke so cheerily
at breakfast and at supper, it almost made them
forget their troubles to see anyone so grateful and
pleased with all they did for him. "Thank you,
ma'am; dest about a good bit a' bacon, this yer"&mdash;locally
the "d" and "j" were often interchangable,
dest for jest, or just&mdash;"That'll be a' plenty
for I, ma'am, doan't want more'n I can yet"&mdash;don't
want more than I can eat, don't want to be greedy&mdash;"Thank
you, miss; dest about some ripping
good ale, this yer; that it be."</p>

<p>He so thoroughly enjoyed and appreciated the
bacon, and the cheese, and the ale; he was like a
great, big human dog; you know how we like to
see a big dog wag his tail at his food, or put his
paws on our knees and laugh, as it were, with his
eyes in our face. They petted him, these two
women, exactly as if he had been a dog, giving him
all the bones, literally and metaphorically, the actual
bones of the meat, and any scraps there were, to
take home with him (besides his regular meals),
and now and then some trifles of clothing for his
aged mother. The dog most thoroughly appreciated
this treatment; he rolled in it, revelled in it,
grew shiny and fat, and glistened with happiness.</p>

<p>Iden petted him, too, to some degree, out of
doors, and for much the same reason; his cheery
content and willingness, and the absence of the
usual selfish niggardliness of effort. George worked
willingly and fairly, and, if occasion needed, stayed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
another hour, or put his shoulder to the wheel of
his own accord, and so, having a good employer,
and not one minded to take advantage of him, was
rewarded in many ways. Iden did not reduce his
wages by a shilling or eighteenpence in winter,
and gave him wood for firing, half a sack of potatoes,
garden produce, or apples, and various other
things from time to time.</p>

<p>Living partly indoors, and being of this disposition,
Jearje was more like a retainer than a servant,
or labourer; a humble member of the family.</p>

<p>It was a sight to see him eat. Amaryllis and
Mrs. Iden used often to watch him covertly, just
for the amusement it gave them. He went about
it as steadily and deliberately as the horses go to
plough; no attempt to caracole in the furrow, ready
to stand still as long as you like.</p>

<p>Bacon three inches thick with fat: the fat of
beef; fat of mutton&mdash;anything they could not
finish in the sitting-room; the overplus of cabbage
or potatoes, savoury or unsavoury; vast slices
of bread and cheese; ale, and any number of slop-basins
full of tea&mdash;the cups were not large enough&mdash;and
pudding, cold dumpling, hard as wood, no
matter what, Jearje ate steadily through it.</p>

<p>A more willing fellow never lived; if Mrs. Iden
happened to want anything from the town ever so
late, though George had worked hard the long day
through from half-past five in the morning, off he
would start, without sign of demur, five miles there
and back, and come in singing with his burden.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span></p>

<p>There are such, as George still among the labourer
class, in despite of the change of circumstance and
sentiment, men who would be as faithful as the
faithfullest retainer who ever <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'acccompanied'">accompanied</ins> a
knight of old time to the Crusade. But, observe,
for a good man there must be a good master.
Proud Iden was a good master, who never forgot
that his man was not a piece of mechanism, but
flesh and blood and feelings.</p>

<p>Now this great human dog, sprawling his strong
arms abroad on the oaken table, warming his
heavily-booted feet at the hearth, always with a
cheery word and smile, by his constant presence
there slowly wore away the impression of the
bailiff, and the dear old kitchen came to be itself
again.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 122px;">
<img src="images/b.png" width="122" height="120" alt="B" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>UT all these shocks and worries and
trampling upon her emotions made the
pencil tremble in the artist's hand as
she worked in the gaunt garret.</div>

<p>One day, as she was returning from
Woolhorton, Iden's solicitor, from whom he had
borrowed money, overtook her, walked his horse,
and began to talk to her in his perky, affected,
silly way. Of all the fools in Woolhorton town
there was none equal in pure idiotcy to this
namby-pamby fellow&mdash;it was wonderful how a man
of Iden's intelligence could trust his affairs to such
a man, the more so as there was at least one good
lawyer in the place. This is very characteristic of
the farming race; they will work like negroes in
the field, and practise the utmost penury to save a
little, and be as cautious over a groat as the keenest
miser, and then go and trust their most important
affairs to some perfect fool of a solicitor. His
father, perhaps, or his uncle, or somebody connected
with the firm, had a reputation about the era of
Waterloo, and upon this tradition they carry their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
business to a man whom they admit themselves
"doan't seem up to much, yon." In the same way,
or worse, for there is no tradition even in this case,
they will consign a hundred pounds' worth of milk
to London on the mere word of a milkman's agent,
a man of straw for aught they know, and never so
much as go up to town to see if there is such a
milk business in existence.</p>

<p>This jackanapes began to talk to Amaryllis about
her father. "Now, don't you think, Miss Iden,
you could speak to your father about these money
matters; you know he's getting into a pound, he
really is (the jackanapes pretended to hunt); he'll
be pounded. Now, don't you think you could talk
to him, and persuade him to be more practical?"</p>

<p>The chattering of this tom-tit upset Amaryllis
more than the rudeness of the gruff baker who
forced his way in, and would not go. That such a
contemptible nincompoop should dare to advise her
father to be practical! The cleverest man in the
world&mdash;advise him to be practical; as if, indeed,
he was not practical and hard-working to the very
utmost.</p>

<p>To her it was a bitter insult. The pencil
trembled in her hand.</p>

<p>But what shook it most of all was anxiety about
her mother. Ever since the bailiff's intrusion Mrs.
Iden had seemed so unsettled. Sometimes she
would come downstairs after the rest had retired,
and sit by the dying fire for hours alone, till Iden
chanced to wake, and go down for her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>Once she went out of doors very late, leaving
the front door wide open, and Amaryllis found her
at midnight wandering in an aimless way among
the ricks.</p>

<p>At such times she had a glazed look in her eyes,
and did not seem to see what she gazed at. At
others she would begin to cry without cause, and
gave indications of hysteria. The nervous Flamma
family were liable to certain affections of that kind,
and Amaryllis feared lest her mother's system had
been overstrained by these continual worries.</p>

<p>Poor woman! she had, indeed, been worried
enough to have shaken the strongest; and, having
nothing stolid in her nature, it pressed upon her.</p>

<p>After awhile these attacks seemed to diminish,
and Amaryllis hoped that nothing would come of it,
but it left her in a state of extreme anxiety lest
some fresh trouble should happen to renew the
strain.</p>

<p>When she thought of her mother she could not
draw&mdash;the sound of her shuffling, nervous footstep
on the landing or the path outside under the
window stopped her at once. These things disheartened
her a thousand times more than the returned
sketches the postman was always bringing.</p>

<p>On butter-making mornings, once a week, there
was always a great to-do; Mrs. Iden, like nervous
people, was cross and peevish when she was exceptionally
busy, and clapper-clawed Iden to some purpose.
It chanced that Amaryllis one day was just
opening an envelope and taking out a returned<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
drawing, when Iden entered, angry and fresh from
Mrs. Iden's tongue, and, seeing the letter, began
to growl:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Better drow that there fool stuff in the vire,
and zee if you can't help your mother. Better do
zummat to be some use on. Pity as you wasn't a
boy chap to go out and yarn summat. Humph!
humph!" growl, mutter, growl. "Drow" was
local for throw, "summat" for something, "yarn"
for earn. Unless I give you a vocabulary you may
not be able to follow him.</p>

<p>The contemptuous allusion to her sketches as fool
stuff, contrasted with the benefit and advantage of
earning something&mdash;something real and solid&mdash;hit
the artist very hard. That was the thought that
troubled her so much, and paralysed her imagination.
They were unsaleable&mdash;she saw the worthlessness
of them far more than Iden. They were
less in value than the paper on which they were
traced; fool stuff, fit for the fire only.</p>

<p>That was the very thought that troubled her so,
and Iden hit the nail home with his rude speech.
That was the material view; unless a thing be
material, or will fetch something material, it is good
for the fire only.</p>

<p>So it came about that the portfolio was pushed
aside, and dust gathered on it, and on the pencils,
and the india-rubber, and in the little box of vine
charcoal. Amaryllis having arranged her violets
in the tumbler of water in the window niche, sat
down at the table and leant her head on her hand,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
and tried to think what she could do, as she had
thought these many, many days.</p>

<p>The drawings were so unreal, and a sovereign so
real. Nothing in all the world at these moments
seemed to her to be so good and precious as the
round disk of gold which rules everything. The
good that she could do with it&mdash;with just one of
those golden disks!</p>

<p>Did you ever read Al Hariri? That accomplished
scholar, the late Mr. Chenery (of <i>The Times</i>),
translated twenty-six of his poems from the Arabic,
and added most interesting notes. This curious
book is a fusion of the Arabian Nights, Ecclesiastes,
and Rabelais. There is the magical unexpectedness
of the Arabian Nights, the vanity of vanities,
all is vanity, of the Preacher, and the humour of
the French satirist. Wisdom is scattered about it;
at one moment you acknowledge a great thought,
the next you are reproached for a folly, and presently
laugh at a deep jest.</p>

<p>Al Hariri has a bearing upon Amaryllis, because
he sang of the dinar, the Arabian sovereign, the
double-faced dinar, the reverse and the obverse,
head and tail, one side giving everything good, and
the other causing all evil. For the golden disk
has two sides, and two Fates belong to it. First
he chants its praises:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
How noble is that yellow one, whose yellowness is pure,<br />
Which traverses the regions, and whose journeying is afar.<br />
Told abroad are its fame and repute:<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>Its lines are set as the secret sign of wealth;<br />
Its march is coupled with the success of endeavours;<br />
Its bright look is loved by mankind,<br />
As though it had been molten of their hearts.<br />
By its aid whoever has got it in his purse assails boldly,<br />
Though kindred be perished or tardy to help.<br />
Oh! charming are its purity and brightness;<br />
Charming are its sufficiency and help.<br />
How many a ruler is there whose rule has been perfected by it!<br />
How many a sumptuous one is there whose grief, but for it, would be endless!<br />
How many a host of cares has one charge of it put to flight!<br />
How many a full moon has a sum of it brought down!<br />
How many a one, burning with rage, whose coal is flaming,<br />
Has it been secretly whispered to and then his anger has softened.<br />
How many a prisoner, whom his kin had yielded,<br />
Has it delivered, so that his gladness has been unmingled.<br />
Now by the Truth of the Lord whose creation brought it forth,<br />
Were it not for His fear, I should say its power is supreme.<br />
</div>

<p>The sovereign, our dinar, does it not answer
exactly to this poem of the Arabian written in the
days of the Crusades! It is yellow, it is pure, it
travels vast distances, and is as valuable in India as
here, it is famous and has a reputation, the inscription
on it is the mark of its worth, it is the sinew
of war, the world loves its brightness as if it was
coined from their hearts, those who have it in their
purses are bold, it helps every one who has it, it
banishes all cares, and one might say, were it not for
fear of the Lord, that the sovereign was all mighty.</p>

<p>All mighty for good as it seemed to Amaryllis
thinking in her garret, leaning her head on her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
hand, and gazing at her violets; all mighty for
good&mdash;if only she could get the real solid, golden
sovereign!</p>

<p>But the golden coin has another side&mdash;the obverse&mdash;another
Fate, for evil, clinging to it, and
the poet, changing his tone, thunders:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem2'>
Ruin on it for a deceiver and insincere,<br />
The yellow one with two faces like a hypocrite!<br />
It shows forth with two qualities to the eye of him that looks on it,<br />
The adornment of the loved one, the colour of the lover.<br />
Affection for it, think they who judge truly,<br />
Tempts men to commit that which shall anger their Maker.<br />
But for it no thief's right hand were cut off;<br />
Nor would tyranny be displayed by the impious;<br />
Nor would the niggardly shrink from the night-farer;<br />
Nor would the delayed claimant mourn the delay of him that withholds;<br />
Nor would men call to God from the envious who casts at them.<br />
Moreover the worst quality that it possesses<br />
Is that it helps thee not in straits,<br />
Save by fleeing from thee like a runaway slave.<br />
Well done he who casts it away from a hilltop,<br />
And who, when it whispers to him with the whispering of a lover,<br />
Says to it in the words of the truth-speaking, the veracious,<br />
"I have no mind for intimacy with thee,&mdash;begone!"<br />
</div>

<p>"The worst quality that it possesses" remains to
this day, and could Amaryllis have obtained the
sovereign, still it would only have helped her by passing
from her, from her hand to that of the creditor's,
fleeing like a runaway slave.</p>

<p>But Amaryllis surrounded with the troubles of
her father and mother, saw only the good side of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the golden sovereign, only that it was all powerful
to bless.</p>

<p>How unnatural it seems that a girl like this, that
young and fresh and full of generous feelings as
she was, her whole mind should perforce be taken
up with the question of money; an unnatural and
evil state of things.</p>

<p>It seems to me very wicked that it should be so.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'>HOUGH the portfolio was pushed aside
and dust had gathered on the table, except
where her arm touched it, Amaryllis
came daily, and often twice a day,
to her flowers to pray.</div>

<p>From the woods she brought the delicate primrose
opening on the mossy bank among the grey
ash-stoles; the first tender green leaflet of hawthorn
coming before the swallow; the garden
crocus from the grass of the garden; the first green
spikelet from the sward of the meadow; the beautiful
white wild violets gathered in the sunlit April
morning while the nightingale sang.</p>

<p>With these she came to pray each day, at the
window-niche. After she had sat awhile at the
table that morning, thinking, she went and knelt
at the window with her face in her hands; the scent
of the violets filled her hair.</p>

<p>Her prayer was deeper than words and was not
put in language, but came rushing through her
heart;&mdash;"That her dear mother might not suffer any
more, that the strain of ceaseless trouble might be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
removed from her mind, that peace and rest might
come to her in her old age. Let her step become
firm, and the nervousness depart, and her eyes
shine like they used to, so clear and bright, and do
not let the grey hairs show more than they do
now, or increase in number. Let her smile and be
happy and talk cheerfully, and take an interest in
the house and all the order of household things,
and also see and understand that her husband
meant to please her, even in such a little thing as
splitting up useful wood for the fire, that he intended
to please her, and that she might not misunderstand
him any more. He intended to be
kind in many ways, but misfortune had blinded her,
and she took things the wrong way. And give
her more change and friends to ask her out from
home on visits, so that she might be amused, and
make them come to see her and pass the time in
contentment. Give her also enough money to buy
good clothes so as to look nice as she ought to
do, and if possible a conveyance of some kind&mdash;not
a grand carriage, she did not wish for that&mdash;but a
conveyance to drive about now and then, because
she was not so strong as she used to be, and could
not walk far. And let me, thought Amaryllis, let
me be able to give her a watch, for other people
have watches, and my mother has not got one, and
it does seem so strange it should be so after all the
hard work she has done. Let me, too, get her some
nice things to eat, some fish and wine, for she cannot
eat our plain bacon now every day, she has not got<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
an appetite, and her teeth too are bad, and I should
so like to give her a set of artificial teeth that her
food might do her more good. But what I really
want is that she may be happy, and be like my mother
herself really is when she is herself. Give my
father money enough to pay his creditors, for I know
that though he is so quiet and says nothing, these
debts are wearing him out, and I know he wishes
to pay them, and does not willingly keep them
waiting. He is so patient, and so good, and bears
everything, I am sure no one was ever like him, and
it is so dreadful to see him work, work, work, every
day from five o'clock in the morning, and yet to be
always worried with these debts and people that
will not let him have peace one single day. Do,
please, let him have less work to do, it makes
me miserable to see him in the rain, and he is not
young now, and sometimes carrying such heavy
things, great pieces of timber and large trusses of
hay, and making his back ache digging. Surely
it must soon be time for him to leave off working,
he has done such a lot, and I do not think he can
see quite so well as he used to, because he holds the
paper so close to his eyes. Please let him leave
off working soon now and have some rest and
change, and go about with my mother, and when
he is at home not have anything more to do than
his garden, because he is so fond of that; let him
love the flowers again as he used to, and plant some
more, and have nothing harder to do than to gather
the fruit from the trees he has planted. And let<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
me get him some new books to read, because I
know he is so fond of books; he has not had a new
book for so long. Let him go to London and see
people and things, and life, because I know he is
full of ideas and thoughts though he works and
digs, and that is what would do him good. Give
him some money now at last, now he has worked all
these years, forty years on this farm, and ever so
much work before that; do give him some money
at last. Do make my grandfather kinder to him and
not so harsh for the rent, let him give the place to
my father now, for it can be no use to him; let my
father have it for his very own, and then I think he
would be happy after all, he does so like to improve
things and make them beautiful, and if it was his
very own there is so much that he could do. That
would be nice work and work that he would enjoy
doing, and not just to get a few wretched shillings
to pay other people. I am sure he would never be
cross then, and he would be so kind to my mother,
and kind and good to everybody. There is nobody
like him, as you know, in this place; they are not
clever like him, and good to the labouring men and
their families like he is (and so is my mother too);
they are so rough, and so unkind and stupid; I do
not mean anything against them, but they are not
like he is. And if you were to help him he would
soon help the poor people and give them food and
more wages; you know how good he is in his heart.
And he would do it, not because other people should
praise him, but because he would like to do it; if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
he does not go to church his heart is very true, and
it is because he likes to be true and genuine, and
not make any false show. Do, please, help him,
and give him some money, and do, please, let him
have this place for his very own, for I do so fear lest
those who set my grandfather against him, should
have a will made, so that my father should not have
this house and land as he ought to do, as the son.
He has made it so beautiful with trees, and brought
the fresh spring water up to the house, and done
so many clever things, and his heart is here, and it
is home to him, and no other place could be like it.
I think it would kill him not to have it, and for me,
I should be so&mdash;I cannot tell, I should be so miserable
if he did not, but I will not think of myself.
There are so many things I know he wants to do if
only he was not so worried with debts, and if he
could feel it was his own land; he wants to plant a
copse, and to make a pond by the brook, and have
trout in it, and to build a wall by the rick-yard.
Think how my dear father has worked all these
years, and do help him now, and give him some
money, and this place, and please do not let him
grow any more grey than his hair is now, and save
his eyes, for he is so fond of things that are beautiful,
and please make my mother happy with him."</p>

<p>When Amaryllis rose from her knees her face
was quite white, emotion had taken away her colour,
and tears were thick on her cheek. She sat a little
while by the table to recover herself, still thinking,
and remembered that again last night she had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
dreamed the same dream about fire in the thatch.
Somehow there seemed to be an alarm in the night,
and they ran out of doors and found the corner of
the roof on fire, over the window with the wire network
instead of glass. It ran up from the corner
towards the chimney, where the roof was mossy by
the ridge. There was no flame, but a deep red
seething heat, as if the straw burned inwardly, and
was glowing like molten metal. Each straw seemed
to lie in the furious heat, and a light to flicker up
and down, as if it breathed fire. The thatch was
very thick there, she knew, and recollected it quite
well in her dream; Iden himself had laid on two
thick coats in his time, and it was heavy enough
before then. He talked about the thatching of it,
because it was an argument with him that straw
had a great power of endurance, and was equal to
slates for lasting. This thickness, she saw, was
the reason the fire did not blaze up quickly, and
why, fortunately, it was slow in moving up the
roof. It had not yet eaten through, so that there
was no draught&mdash;once it got through, it would burn
fast&mdash;if only they could put it out before then all
might yet be saved. In the midst of her anxiety
Iden came with the largest ladder in the rickyard,
and mounted up, carrying a bucket of water. She
tried to follow, holding on to the rungs of the
ladder with one hand, and dragging up a heavy
bucket with the other&mdash;the strain and effort to get
up woke her.</p>

<p>This dream had happened to her so many times,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
and was so vivid and circumstantial&mdash;the fire
seemed to glow in the thatch&mdash;that at last she
began to dread lest it should come true. If it did
not come true of the house itself, perhaps it would
of the family, and of their affairs; perhaps it signified
that the fire of debt, and poverty, and misfortune
would burn them, as it were, to the ground.
She tried to think whether in the dream they were
getting the fire under before she woke, or whether
they could not master it; it seemed dubious.</p>

<p>She did not tell her mother of the dream, afraid
lest it might excite her again; nor could she tell
Iden, who would have laughed at her.</p>

<p>Yet, though she knew it was but a dream, and
dreams have ceased to come true, she did not like
it; she felt uncertain, as if some indefinable danger
was threatening round about. As she sat at the
table she added to her prayer the supplication that
the dear old house might not be burned down.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards she went down stairs, and on
the lower flight paused, to listen to voices&mdash;not
those of her mother and Iden&mdash;creditors, doubtless,
come to cry aloud, "Pay me that thou owest!"&mdash;the
very sum and total of religion. Her heart
beat quicker&mdash;the voices came again, and she
thought she recognized them, and that they were
not those of creditors. She entered the sitting-room,
and found that two visitors, from widely
separated places, had arrived; one with a portmanteau,
the other with an old, many-coloured
carpet-bag. They were Amadis Iden, from Iden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Court, over the Downs, the Court Idens, as they
were called, and Alere Flamma, from London; the
Flammas were carpet-bag people.</p>

<p>Her father was making them very welcome, after
his wont, and they were talking of the house the
Idens of yore had built in a lonely spot, expressly
in order that they might drink, drink, drink <ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads 'undiddisturbed'">undisturbed</ins>
by their unreasonable wives.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 121px;">
<img src="images/t.png" width="121" height="120" alt="T" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>HEY talked on and on, these three,
Iden, Amadis Iden, and Alere Flamma,
with Amaryllis listening, from the end
of April till near the end of May; till
"a month passed away," and still they
were talking. For there is nothing so good to the
human heart as well agreed conversation, when you
know that your companion will answer to your
thought as the anvil meets the hammer, ringing
sound to merry stroke; better than wine, better
than sleep, like love itself&mdash;for love is agreement
of thought&mdash;"God listens to those who pray to
him; let us eat and drink, and think of nothing,"
says the Arabian proverb. So they ate and drank&mdash;very
moderate the drinking&mdash;and thought of
nothing, and talked, which should be added to complete
felicity. Not, of course, all of them always
together, sometimes all four, sometimes Alere,
Amadis, and Amaryllis, sometimes only the last two.</div>

<p>The round summer-house was their Parliament
House whenever the east winds sank and the flowers
shone forth like sunshine; as the sun shines when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
the clouds withdraw, so when the harsh east winds
cease the May flowers immediately bloom and glow.</p>

<p>It was a large round house, properly builded of
brick, as a summer-house should be&mdash;put not thy
faith in lath work&mdash;and therefore dry and warm;
to sit in it was like sitting in a shell, warm and
comfortable, with a sea of meadow-grass, smooth
and coloured, stretching in front, islanded about
with oak, and elm, and ash.</p>

<p>The finches came to the boughs that hung over
the ivy-grown thatch, and sang in the sycamore
opposite the door, and in the apple-trees, whose
bloom hung down almost to the ground.</p>

<p>These apple-trees, which Iden had planted, flung
sackfuls of bloom at his feet. They poured themselves
out in abandoned, open-armed, spendthrift,
wasteful&mdash;perfectly prodigal&mdash;quantities of rose-tinted
petal; prodigal as a river which flows full to
the brim, never questioning but what there will be
plenty of water to follow.</p>

<p>Flowers, and trees, and grass, seemed to spring
up wherever Iden set down his foot: fruit and
flowers fell from the air down upon him. It was
his genius to make things grow&mdash;like sunshine and
shower; a sort of Pan, a half-god of leaves and
boughs, and reeds and streams, a sort of Nature in
human shape, moving about and sowing Plenty and
Beauty.</p>

<p>One side of the summer-house was a thick holly-bush,
Iden had set it there; he builded the summer-house
and set the ivy; and the pippin at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
back, whose bloom was white; the copper-birch
near by; the great sycamore alone had been there
before him, but he set a seat under it, and got
woodbine to flower there; the drooping-ash he
planted, and if Amaryllis stood under it when
the tree was in full leaf you could not see her,
it made so complete an arbour; the Spanish oak
in the corner; the box hedge along the ha-ha
parapet; the red currants against the red wall; the
big peony yonder; the damsons and pear; the
yellow honey-bush; all these, and this was but one
square, one mosaic of the garden, half of it sward,
too, and besides these there was the rhubarb-patch
at one corner; fruit, flowers, plants, and herbs,
lavender, parsley, which has a very pleasant green,
growing in a thick bunch, roses, pale sage&mdash;read
Boccaccio and the sad story of the leaf of sage&mdash;ask
Nature if you wish to know how many things
more there were.</p>

<p>A place to eat and drink, and think of nothing
in, listening to the goldfinches, and watching them
carry up the moss, and lichen, and slender fibres
for their nest in the fork of the apple; listening to
the swallows as they twittered past, or stayed on
the sharp, high top of the pear tree; to the vehement
starlings, whistling and screeching like Mrs.
Iden herself, on the chimneys; chaffinches "chink,
chink," thrushes, distant blackbirds, who like oaks;
"cuckoo, cuckoo," "crake, crake," buzzing and
burring of bees, coo of turtle-doves, now and then
a neigh, to remind you that there were horses,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
fulness and richness of musical sound; a world of
grass and leaf, humming like a hive with voices.</p>

<p>When the east wind ceases, and the sun shines
above, and the flowers beneath, "a summer's day
in lusty May," then is the time an Interlude in
Heaven.</p>

<p>And all this, summer-house and all, had dropped
out of the pocket of Iden's ragged old coat.</p>

<p>There was a magic power of healing in the influences
of this place which Iden had created. Both
Amadis and Alere Flamma had already changed
for the better.</p>

<p>That morning when Amaryllis had found them,
just arrived, the one with a portmanteau, and the
other with a carpet-bag, they were both pale to
the last degree of paleness.</p>

<p>Three years had gone by since Amadis had stayed
at Coombe Oaks before, when Amaryllis was thirteen
and he eighteen; fine romps they had then, a
great girl, and a great boy, rowing on the water,
walking over the hills, exploring the woods;
Amadis shooting and fishing, and Amaryllis going
with him, a kind of gamekeeper page in petticoats.
They were of the same stock of Idens, yet no relations;
he was of the older branch, Amaryllis of the
younger.</p>

<p>She had grown into a woman; Amadis Iden
into a man.</p>

<p>Sadly, indeed, he had altered. Looking at him,
she could scarce believe he was the same; so pale,
so thin, so drooping, and fireless&mdash;the spark of life<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
sunk into the very ashes. He sat at the dinner-table
that morning like a ghost. He was convalescent
from low fever: that dread disease which has
taken the place of ague in the country. At one
time it was ague; in these times it is low fever.</p>

<p>At Coombe Oaks they had heard of his illness
in a far-off way, but had received no distinct particulars,
for the news came in a roundabout way
by word of mouth, country-folk never write. The
distance between the two houses was less than ten
miles, and might as well have been five hundred
for all the communication.</p>

<p>So that the ghastly paleness of his face came
upon her as a spectre in daylight. You could see
at a glance what was wrong&mdash;the vital energy had
been sapped; as a tree fades without a branch
broken, or bark scored, fades and withers from the
lack of the mysterious force which brings forth
fresh leaves, so he drooped in his chair. The body&mdash;the
tree&mdash;was there, but the life was not in it.</p>

<p>Alere Flamma, aged forty-nine, or nearly, was
pale from other causes, and it was a different kind
of paleness; not bloodlessness, like Amadis, but
something lacking in the blood, a vitiated state.
Too much Fleet Street, in short; too much of the
Oracle&mdash;Pantagruel's Oracle of the Bottle.</p>

<p>His hands shook as he held his knife and fork&mdash;oddly
enough, the hands of great genius often do
shake; now and then when he put his glass to his
lips, his teeth snapped on it, and chinked.</p>

<p>It seemed curious that such puffy, shaky hands<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
could hold a pencil, and draw delicate lines without
a flaw.</p>

<p>Many who never resort to the Oracle have hands
that tremble nearly as much&mdash;the nervous constitution&mdash;and
yet execute artists' work of rare excellence.</p>

<p>Alere's constitution, the Flamma constitution,
naturally nervous, had been shaken as with dynamite
by the bottle, and the glass chinked against
his teeth. Every two or three years, when he felt
himself toppling over like a tree half sawn through,
Alere packed his carpet-bag, and ran down to Coombe
Oaks. When the rats began to run up the wall as
he sat at work in broad daylight, Alere put his slippers
into his carpet-bag and looked out some collars.</p>

<p>In London he never wore a collar, only a bright
red scarf round his neck; the company he kept
would have shunned him&mdash;they would have looked
him up and down disdainfully:&mdash;"Got a collar on&mdash;had
no breakfast." They would have scornfully
regarded him as no better than a City clerk, the
class above all others scorned by those who use
tools.</p>

<p>"Got a collar on&mdash;had no breakfast." The City
clerk, playing the Masher on thirty shillings a
week, goes without food to appear the gentleman.</p>

<p>Alere, the artist, drank with the men who used
hammer, and file, or set up type&mdash;a godless set, ye
gods, how godless, these setters up of type at four
o'clock in the morning; oysters and stout at 4 a.m.;
special taverns they must have open for them&mdash;open<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
before Aurora gleams in the east&mdash;Oh! Fleet
Street, Fleet Street, what a place it is!</p>

<p>By no possible means could Alere work himself
into a dress-coat.</p>

<p>Could he have followed the celebrated advice&mdash;"You
put on a dress-coat and go into society"&mdash;he
would soon have become a name, a fame, a taker
of big fees, a maker of ten thousand yearly.</p>

<p>To a man who could draw like Alere, possessed,
too, of the still rarer talent&mdash;the taste to see what
to draw&mdash;there really is no limit in our days; for
as for colour, you do not require a genius for colour
in an age of dinginess&mdash;why, the point, nowadays,
is to avoid colour, and in a whole Academy you
shall scarcely find as much as would tint a stick of
sealing-wax.</p>

<p>"You put on a black coat and go into society"&mdash;that
is the secret of commissions, and commissions
are fortune. Nothing so clever in the way of
advice has been sent forth as that remark. The
great Tichborne said something about folk that had
money and no brains, and folk that had brains but
no money; and they as has no brains ought to be
so managed as to supply money to those who had.
But even the greatness of the great Tichborne's
observation falls into insignificance before Chesterfield
in one sentence: "Put on a black coat and go
into society."</p>

<p>What are the sayings of the seven wise men of
Greece compared to <i>that</i>?</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/b.png" width="120" height="122" alt="B" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>Y no possible means could Alere Flamma
work himself into a dress coat.
The clubs, the houses of the great, the
mutual admiration dinners&mdash;those great
institutions of the day&mdash;were all closed
to him because of the Dress Coat.</div>

<p>If he had really desired to enter, of course he
would have squeezed into the evening monkey-skin
somehow; but, in truth, Alere did not want to enter.</p>

<p>Inside he might have finished a portrait a month
at a thousand guineas&mdash;twelve portraits per annum
equals twelve thousand guineas a year; you see I
am looking up the multiplication table, preparatory
to going into the tallow trade.</p>

<p>What he actually did was to make designs for
book-covers&mdash;magnificent book-covers that will one
day fetch their weight in bank-notes&mdash;manipulating
a good deal of it himself&mdash;"tooling"&mdash;for the
libraries of noble connoisseurs. They were equal
to anything ever done in Paris.</p>

<p>For a week's work&mdash;say half-an-hour a day&mdash;he
got perhaps about ten pounds. With the ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
pounds he was satisfied&mdash;ten pounds represents a
good deal of brandy, or stout, or even wine, about
as much as one man can manage at a bout; besides
tobacco, the gallery at the theatre, and innumerable
trifles of that kind. Ten pounds represents a good
deal of street life.</p>

<p>Sometimes he drew&mdash;and engraved&mdash;illustrations
for books, being as clever with the engraver's tools
as with the pencil; sometimes he cut out those
odd, fantastic "initials," "ornaments," "finials,"
which are now so commonly seen in publications,
catching the classical grotesque of the Renaissance
to perfection, and deceiving the experienced; sometimes
he worked in the press-room in the House of
Flamma, Fleet Street, pulling artists' proofs, or
printing expensively illustrated volumes&mdash;numbered,
and the plates destroyed&mdash;actual manual work, in
his shirt sleeves.</p>

<p>He could stop when he liked and take a swig of
stout. That was the Alere style.</p>

<p>Smoking was forbidden in the old House of
Flamma because of the worm-eaten beams, the
worm-eaten rafters and staircase, the dusty, decayed
bookshelves, the dry, rotten planks of the floor, the
thin wooden partitions, all ready to catch fire at
the mere sight of a match. Also because of the
piles of mouldy books which choked the place, and
looked fit for nothing but a bonfire, but which were
worth thousands of pounds; the plates and lithographic
stones, artists' proofs, divers and sundry
Old Masters in a room upstairs, all easily destructible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>But Alere, being a son of the house, though not
in command, did not choose to be amenable to rules
and orders in fact, in fiction he was. He smoked
and kept the glue-pot ready on the stove; if a
certain step was known to be approaching the
pipe was thrust out of sight, and some dry glue set
melting, the powerful incense quite hiding the
flavour of tobacco. A good deal of dry glue is
used in London in this way.</p>

<p>If I could but write the inside history of Fleet
Street, I should be looked upon as the most wonderful
exponent of human life that had ever touched
a pen. Balzac&mdash;whom everybody talks of and
nobody has read, because the discrimination of
Paternoster Row has refused him a translation till
quite lately&mdash;Zola, who professes to be realistic,
who is nothing if not realistic, but whose writings
are so curiously crude and merely skim the surface;
even the great Hugo, who produced the masterpiece
of all fiction, <i>Les Mis&eacute;rables</i>; all three of
them, the entire host of manuscript-makers, I am
sure I could vanquish them all, if I could only
write the inside life of Fleet Street.</p>

<p>Not in any grace of style or sweeping march of
diction, but just pencil-jotted in the roughest words
to hand, just as rich and poor, well-dressed ladies
and next-door beggars are bundled into a train, so,
without choice of language, but hustling the first
words anyhow, as it were, into the first compartment.
If I could only get Alere to tell me all he had
seen in Fleet Street, and could just jot it down on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
margin of a stained newspaper, all the world would
laugh and weep. For such things do go on in Fleet
Street as no man has written yet.</p>

<p>If only Victor Hugo were alive and young again!</p>

<p>Alere liked pulling off the proofs in his shirt-sleeves,
swigging his stout, smoking on the sly,
working with all the genius of an inspired mechanic
one moment and dropping into absolute idleness the
next, spending infinite pains in finishing one bit of
work, as if his very life depended on the smoothing
of an edge of paper, putting off the next till the
end of the month, pottering, sleeping, gossiping,
dreaming over old German works, and especially
dreaming over Goethe, humming old German
songs&mdash;for he had been a great traveller&mdash;sometimes
scrawling a furious Mazzinian onslaught in a
semi-Nihilist foreign print, collecting stray engravings,
wandering hither and thither.</p>

<p>Alere Flamma, artist, engraver, bookbinder, connoisseur,
traveller, printer, Republican, conspirator,
sot, smoker, dreamer, poet, kind-hearted, good-natured,
prodigal, shiftless, man of Fleet Street,
carpet-bag man, gentleman shaken to pieces.</p>

<p>He worked in his shirt-sleeves and drank stout,
but nothing vulgar had ever been recorded against
Alere Flamma. He frequented strong company&mdash;very
strong meat&mdash;but no vile word left his
lips.</p>

<p>There was a delicacy in all his ways in the midst
of the coarsest surroundings, just as he appeared in
the press-room among the printer's ink in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
whitest of clean shirt-sleeves, fit to wear with the
abhorred dress-coat.</p>

<p>In his rooms at his lodgings there were literally
hundreds of sketches, done on all sorts and sizes of
paper, from the inside of an envelope hastily torn
open to elephant. The bureau was full of them,
crammed in anyhow, neither sorted nor arranged;
nothing, of course, could be found if it was wanted.
The drawers of the bookcase&mdash;it was his own furniture&mdash;were
full of them; the writing-table drawer;
a box in one corner; some were on the mantelpiece
smoked and gritty; some inside his books, most of
which were interleaved in this manner; literally
hundreds of sketches, the subjects as numerous and
varied.</p>

<p>Views in English country lanes, views on the
Danube, bands playing in band-loving Vienna, old
Highgate Archway, studies from Canterbury Cathedral,
statuary in the Louvre, ships battling with
the north wind in the North Sea&mdash;a savage fight
between sail and gale&mdash;horses in the meadow, an
aged butler, a boy whipping a top, charcoal-burners
in the Black Forest, studies from the nude&mdash;Parisian
models, Jewesses, almost life-size, a drayman
heaving up a huge tankard, overshadowing his face
like Mount Atlas turned over his thumb, designs
to illustrate classical mythology, outlines expressing
the ideas of Goethe&mdash;outlines of Marguerite and
Faust among the roses&mdash;"He loves me; he loves
me not," big-armed Flemish beauties with breasts
as broad as the Zuyder-Zee was deep in the song,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
roofs of Nuremberg, revolutionary heroes charging
their muskets in the famous year '48, when Alere
had a bullet through his hat, in Vienna, I think;
no end to them.</p>

<p>Sometimes when Alere had done no work for a
month or two, and his ten pounds were spent, if he
wanted a few guineas he would take a small selection
of these round to the office of a certain illustrated
paper; the Editor would choose, and hand
over the money at once, well aware that it was
ready money his friend needed. They were not
exactly friends&mdash;there are no friends in London,
only acquaintances&mdash;but a little chummy, because
the Editor himself had had a fiery youth, and they
had met in sunny Wien. That was the only paper
that ever got sketches out of Alere.</p>

<p>If only Alere would have gone and sketched what
he was <i>asked</i> to sketch! Ah! there is the difference;
he could not do it, his nature would not
let him; he could draw what he saw with his own
eyes, but not what other people wanted him to see.
A merry income he might have made if he would
only have consented to see what other eyes&mdash;common,
vulgar eyes&mdash;wanted to see, and which he
could so easily have drawn for them.</p>

<p>Out of these piles of varied sketches there were
two kinds the Editor instantly snapped at: the one
was wild flowers, the other little landscape bits.</p>

<p>Wild flowers were his passion. They were to
Flamma as Juliet to Romeo. Romeo's love, indeed,
rushed up like straw on fire, a great blaze of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
flame; he perished in it as the straw; perhaps
he might not have worshipped Juliet next year.
Flamma had loved his wild flowers close upon forty
years, ever since he could remember; most likely
longer, for doubtless the dumb infant loved the
daisies put in his chubby hand.</p>

<p>His passion they were still as he drew near fifty,
and saw all things become commonplace. That is
the saddest of thoughts&mdash;as we grow older the
romance fades, and all things become commonplace.</p>

<p>Half our lives are spent in wishing for to-morrow,
the other half in wishing for yesterday.</p>

<p>Wild flowers alone never become commonplace.
The white wood-sorrel at the foot of the oak, the
violet in the hedge of the vale, the thyme on the
wind-swept downs, they were as fresh this year as
last, as dear to-day as twenty years since, even
dearer, for they grow now, as it were, in the earth
we have made for them of our hopes, our prayers,
our emotions, our thoughts.</p>

<p>Sketch-book upon sketch-book in Alere's room
was full of wild flowers, drawn as he had found
them in the lanes and woods at Coombe Oaks&mdash;by
the footpaths, by the lake and the lesser ponds, on
the hills&mdash;as he had found them, not formed into
an artificial design, not torn up by the roots, or
cut and posed for the occasion&mdash;exactly as they
were when his eye caught sight of them. A difficult
thing to do, but Alere did it.</p>

<p>In printing engravings of flowers the illustrated<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
magazines usually make one of two mistakes; either
the flower is printed without any surroundings or
background, and looks thin, quite without interest,
however cleverly drawn, or else it is presented
with a heavy black pall of ink which dabs it out
altogether.</p>

<p>These flowers the Editor bought eagerly, and the
little landscapes. From a stile, beside a rick,
through a gap in a hedge, odd, unexpected places,
Alere caught views of the lake, the vale, the wood,
groups of trees, old houses, and got them in his
magical way on a few square inches of paper. They
were very valuable for book illustration. They
were absolutely true to nature and fact.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'>ERHAPS the reason Alere never took
to colours was because of his inherent
and unswerving truthfulness of character.
Genuine to a degree, he could
not make believe&mdash;could not deceive&mdash;could
not masquerade in a dress-coat.</div>

<p>Now, most of the landscape-painting in vogue
to-day is nature in a dress-coat.</p>

<p>In a whole saloon of water colours, in a whole
Academy, or Grosvenor Gallery you shall hardly
find three works that represent any real scene in
the fields.</p>

<p>I have walked about the fields a good deal in my
brief, fretful hour, yet I have never seen anything
resembling the strange apparitions that are hung
on these walls every spring. Apparitions&mdash;optical
illusions, lit up with watery, greenish, ghastly,
ghost-light&mdash;nothing like them on earth I swear,
and I suspect not in Heaven or Hades.</p>

<p>Touched-up designs: a tree taken from one place,
a brook from another, a house from another&mdash;<i>and
mixed to order</i>, like a prescription by the chemist&mdash;xv.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
grs. grass, 3 dr. stile, iiij. grs. rustic bridge.
Nature never plants&mdash;nature is no gardener&mdash;no
design, no proportion in the fields.</p>

<p>Colours! Passing a gasworks perhaps you may
have noticed that the surface of the water in the
ditch by the roadside bears a greenish scum, a pale
prismatic scum; this is the colour-box of modern
landscape.</p>

<p>How horrible the fields would look if they wore
such hues in reality as are accepted on canvas at
the galleries! Imagine these canvas tints transferred
to the sward, the woods, the hills, the
streams, the sky! <i>Dies ir&aelig;, dies ill&aelig;</i>&mdash;it would,
indeed, be an awful day, the Last Day of Doom,
and we should need the curtain at Drury Lane
drawn before our eyes to shut it out of sight.</p>

<p>There are some who can go near to paint dogs
and horses, but a meadow of mowing grass, not one
of them can paint that.</p>

<p>Many can <i>draw</i> nature&mdash;drawings are infinitely
superior generally to the painting that follows;
scarce one now paints real nature.</p>

<p>Alere could not squeeze his sketches into the
dress-coat of sham colour for any sacred exhibition
wall whatever.</p>

<p>One thing Alere never attempted to draw&mdash;a
bird in flight. He recognized that it was impossible;
his taste rejected every conventional attitude
that has been used for the purpose; the descending
pigeon, the Japanese skewered birds, the swallow
skimming as heavily as a pillow. You cannot draw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
a bird in flight. Swallows are attempted oftenest,
and done worst of all.</p>

<p>How can you draw life itself? What is life? you
cannot even define it. The swallow's wing has the
motion of life&mdash;its tremble&mdash;its wonderful delicacy
of vibration&mdash;the instant change&mdash;the slip of the
air;&mdash;no man will ever be able to draw a flying
swallow.</p>

<p>At the feet of this Gamaliel of Fleet Street, Amaryllis
had sat much, from time to time, when the
carpet-bag was packed and Alere withdrew to his
Baden-Baden&mdash;<i>i.e.</i>, to Coombe Oaks and apple-bloom,
singing finch, and wild-flowers.</p>

<p>There were no "properties" in Alere's room at
his lodgings; no odd bits collected during his
wanderings to come in useful some day as make-up,
realistic rock work, as it were, in the picture. No
gauntlets or breast-plates, scraps of old iron; no
Turkish guns or yataghans, no stags' horns, china,
or carvings to be copied some day into an illustration.
No "properties."</p>

<p>No studio effects. The plaster bust that strikes
the key and tones the visitors' mind to "Art," the
etchings, the wall or panel decorations, the sliding
curtains, the easels in the corner, the great portfolios&mdash;the
well-known "effects" were absent.</p>

<p>A plain room, not even with a north light, plain
old furniture, but not very old&mdash;not ostensibly
ancient, somewhere about 1790 say&mdash;and this inherited
and not purchased; Flamma cared not one
atom for furniture, itself, old or new; dusty books<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
everywhere, under the table, on the mantelpiece,
beside the coal scuttle; heaps on chairs, quartos on
the sofa, crowds more in his bedroom, besides the
two bookcases and drawers; odd books most of
them, Cornelius Agrippa, <i>Le Petit Albert</i>, French
illustrated works, editions of Faust, music, for
Flamma was fond of his many-keyed flute.</p>

<p>Great people once now and then called and asked
to see Alere Flamma at the business place in Fleet
Street; people with titles, curiously out of place,
in the press-room, gold leaf on the floor, odour of
printer's ink, dull blows of machinery, rotten planking,
partitions pasted over with illustrations and
stained with beer, the old place trembling as the
engine worked; Flamma, in his shirt-sleeves, talking
to "His Excellency."</p>

<p>Flamma's opinion, information he could give,
things he knew; abroad they thought much of him.</p>

<p>Presents came occasionally&mdash;a boar's head from
Germany; fine Havana cigars&mdash;Alere always had a
supply of the best cigars and Turkish tobacco, a
perennial stream of tobacco ran for him; English
venison; once a curious dagger from Italy, the
strangest present good-natured Alere could possibly
have received!</p>

<p>Sometimes there came a pressing invitation from
a noble connoisseur to his country seat; Flamma's
views were wanted about the re-arrangement of
the library, the re-binding of some treasure picked
up in a cover all too poor for its value, the building
of another wing, for the artist is the true architect,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
as the princes of Italy knew of old time. Till
the artist is called in we shall never again see real
architecture in the world. Did not Benvenuto
design fortifications? Did not Michael Angelo
build St. Peter's at Rome?</p>

<p>If my lord duke wants a palace he cannot have
it till he calls in the artist, the Alere Flamma,
to draw it for him; if my lord bishop needs a
cathedral he cannot have it till he calls in the poet-draughtsman,
till he goes to Alere Flamma.</p>

<p>Our so-called architects are mere surveyors,
engineers, educated bricklayers, men of hard straight
ruler and square, mathematically accurate, and
utterly devoid of feeling.</p>

<p>The princes of Italy knew better&mdash;they called in
the poet and the painter, the dreamers to dream for
them.</p>

<p>You call in your "practical" architect, and he
builds you a brick box; not for a hundred thousand
pounds in fees could he build you a palace or a
cathedral.</p>

<p>The most ignorant of men are the "practical"
people. It is meet and fitting that they should be
worshipped and set on high. The calf worshipped
of old was at least golden, and these are of lead.</p>

<p>But Alere could not go; he would do anything
he was asked in this way; he would take infinite
pains to please, but he could not leave Fleet Street
for any mansion.</p>

<p>When a man once gets into Fleet Street he
cannot get out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>Conventionally, I suppose, it would be the right
thing to represent Alere as a great genius neglected,
or as a genius destroyed by intemperance. The
conventional type is so easy&mdash;so accepted&mdash;so
popular; it would pay better, perhaps, to make
him out a victim in some way.</p>

<p>He was not neglected, neither was he the victim
of intemperance in the usual sense.</p>

<p>The way to fame and fortune had always been
wide open to him; there were long intervals when
he did not drink, nor did drink enfeeble his touch;
it was not half so much to struggle against as the
chest diseases from which professional men so often
suffer; I believe if he had really tried or wished he
could have conquered his vice altogether. Neither
of these causes kept him from the foremost rank.</p>

<p>There was no ambition, and there was no business-avarice.
So many who have no ideal are kept hard
at work by the sheer desire of money, and thus
spurred onward, achieve something approaching
greatness. Alere did not care for money.</p>

<p>He could not get out of Fleet Street. Ten
pounds was a large sum in the company he frequented;
he did not want any more.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/s.png" width="120" height="120" alt="S" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>OMETHING in Fleet Street holds tight
those who once come within its influence.
The cerebellum of the world,
the "grey matter" of the world's
brain, lies somewhere thereabouts. The
thoughts of our time issue thence, like the radiating
spokes of a wheel, to all places of the earth. There
you have touch of the throbbing pulse of the vast
multitudes that live and breathe. Their ideas
come from Fleet Street.</div>

<p>From the printing-press and the engraver's
wood-block, the lithographic-stone, the etcher's
plate, from book and magazine, periodical and
pamphlet, from world-read newspaper.</p>

<p>From Fleet Street, the centre whence ideas flow
outwards.</p>

<p>It is joyous to be in the flower-grown meads; it
is sweet to be on the hill-top; delicious to feel the
swell and the long roll of the hexameter of the
seas; doubtless there is a wild rapture on the summit
of the Himalayas; triumph in the heart of the
African explorer at the river's source. But if once<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
the mind has been dipped in Fleet Street, let the
meads be never so sweet, the mountain-top never so
exalted, still to Fleet Street the mind will return,
because there is that other Mind, without whose
sympathy even success is nothing&mdash;the Mind of
the world.</p>

<p>I am, of course, thinking not only of the thoroughfare,
Fleet Street, but of all that the printing-press
means.</p>

<p>Alere was no leader of thought, but it was necessary
to him to live and breathe in the atmosphere
of thought&mdash;to feel the throb and swell around him&mdash;to
be near the "grey matter" of the world's
brain.</p>

<p>Once a man gets into Fleet Street he cannot get
out. Flamma would not leave it for months of
gilded idleness in any nobleman's mansion.</p>

<p>The flame must be fed. His name had some
connection with the design of the Roman lamp on
the splendid bindings of the books tooled in the
House of Flamma. <i>Alere Flammam</i>&mdash;feed the flame.
The flame of the mind must be fed.</p>

<p>Sad things happen on the stones of Fleet Street;
if I could but get at it all to write the inside life of
it, it would, indeed, be a book. Stone-cold poverty
hovers about. The rich, living in the fool's paradise
of money, think they know life, but they do not,
for, as was said of the sea&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
Only those who share its dangers<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1.5em;">Comprehend its mystery.</span><br />
</div>

<p>Only those who have shared the struggle literally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
for bread&mdash;for a real, actual loaf&mdash;understand the
dread realities of man's existence.</p>

<p>Let but a morsel of wood&mdash;a little splinter of
deal, a curl of carpenter's shaving&mdash;lie in Fleet
Street, and it draws to it the wretched human beasts
as surely as the offal draws the beast of the desert
to the camp. A morsel of wood in the streets that
are paved with gold!</p>

<p>It is so valuable. Women snatch it up and roll
it in their aprons, clasping it tightly, lest it should
somehow disappear. Prowling about from street
to street, mile after mile, they fill their aprons with
these precious splinters of deal, for to those who
are poor fuel is as life itself.</p>

<p>Even the wealthy, if they have once been ill,
especially of blood-thinning diseases (as rheumatism),
sometimes say they would rather go without
food than coal. Rather emptiness than chill.</p>

<p>These women know where there are hoardings
erected by builders, where shop-fronts are being
rebuilt, where fires have taken place, where
alterations are proceeding; they know them as
the birds know the places where they are likely
to find food, and visit them day by day for the
scraps of wood and splinters that drop on the
pavement.</p>

<p>Or they send their children, ragged urchins,
battling for a knot of pine-wood.</p>

<p>The terror of frost to these creatures is great
indeed. Frost is the King of Terrors to them&mdash;not
Death; they sleep and live with death constantly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
the dead frequently in the room with the living,
and with the unborn that is near birth.</p>

<p>Alere's ten pounds helped them. The drunkard's
wife knew that Flamma, the drinker, would certainly
give her the silver in his pocket.</p>

<p>The ragged urchins, battling for a knot of pine-wood,
knew that they could charm the pennies and
the threepenny bits out of his waistcoat; the baked
potatoes and the roasted chestnuts looked so nice
on the street stove.</p>

<p>Wretched girls whose power of tempting had
gone, and with it their means of subsistence,
begged, and not in vain, of shaky Alere Flamma.
There are many of these wretches in Fleet Street.
There is no romance about them to attract the
charity of the world.</p>

<p>Once a flower-girl, selling flowers without a
licence in the street, was charged by the police.
How this harshness to the flower-girl&mdash;the human
representation of Flora&mdash;roused up sentiment in
her behalf!</p>

<p>But not every starving girl has the fortune to
rouse up sentiment and to be fed. Their faces disfigured
with eruptions, their thin shoulders, their
dry, disordered hair&mdash;hair never looks nice unless
soft with its natural oil&mdash;their dingy complexions,
their threadbare shawls, tempt no one. They cannot
please, therefore they must starve.</p>

<p>The good turn from them with horror&mdash;Are they
not sin made manifest? The trembling hand of
Alere fed them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></p>

<p>Because the boys bawl do you suppose they are
happy? It is curious that people should associate
noise with a full stomach. The shoeblack boys,
the boys that are gathered into institutions and
training ships, are expected to bawl and shout
their loudest at the annual f&ecirc;tes when visitors
are present. Your bishops and deans forthwith
feel assured that their lives are consequently
joyous.</p>

<p>Why then do they set fire to training ships?
Why do they break out of reformatory institutions?
Bawling is not necessarily happiness. Yet fatuous
fools are content if only they can hear a good uproar
of bawling.</p>

<p>I have never walked up Fleet Street and the
Strand yet without seeing a starving woman and
child. The children are indeed dreadful; they run
unguarded and unwatched out of the side courts
into the broader and more lively Strand&mdash;the ceaseless
world pushes past&mdash;they play on the pavement
unregarded. Hatless, shoeless, bound about with
rags, their faces white and scarred with nameless
disease, their eyes bleared, their hair dirty; little
things, such as in happy homes are sometimes set
on the table to see how they look.</p>

<p>How <i>can</i> people pass without seeing them?</p>

<p>Alere saw them, and his hand went to his waistcoat
pocket.</p>

<p>The rich folk round about this great Babylon of
Misery, where cruel Want sits on the Seven Hills&mdash;make
a cartoon of that!&mdash;the rich folk who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
receive hundreds on the turn of a stock, who go to
the Bank of England on dividend days&mdash;how easily
the well-oiled doors swing open for them!&mdash;who
dwell in ease and luxury at Sydenham, at Norwood,
at Surbiton, at Streatham, at Brighton, at Seven-oaks,
wherever there is pure air, have distinguished
themselves lately in the giving of alms, ordained
by the Lord whom they kneel before each Sunday,
clad in silk, scarlet, and fine linen, in their cushioned
pews.</p>

<p>They have established Homes for Lost Dogs
and Homes for Lost Cats, neither of which are such
nuisances as human beings.</p>

<p>In the dog institution they have set up an apparatus
specially designed by one of the leading
scientific men of the age. The dogs that are not
claimed in a certain time, or that have become
diseased&mdash;like the human nuisances&mdash;are put into
this apparatus, into a comfortable sort of chamber,
to gnaw their last bone. By-and-by, a scientific
vapour enters the chamber, and breathing this, the
animal falls calmly to death, painlessly poisoned in
peace.</p>

<p>Seven thousand dogs were thus happily chloroformed
"into eternity" in one season. Jubilant
congratulations were exchanged at the success of
the apparatus. Better than shooting, drowning,
hanging, vivisection, or starvation!</p>

<p>Let a dog die in peace. Is not this an age of
humanity indeed? To sell all you have and give
to the poor was nothing compared to this. We<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
have progressed since Anno Domini I. We know
better how to do it now.</p>

<p>Alere did not seem to trouble himself much
about the dogs; he saw so much of the human
nuisances.</p>

<p>What a capital idea it would be to set up an apparatus
like this in the workhouses and in conjunction
with the hospitals!</p>

<p>Do you know, thoughtless, happy maiden, singing
all the day, that one out of every five people
who die in London, die in the workhouse or the
hospital?</p>

<p>Eighty-two thousand people died in London in
1882, and of these, fourteen thousand expired in
the workhouses, and six thousand in hospitals!</p>

<p>Are not these ghastly figures? By just setting
up a few Apparatuses, see what an immense amount
of suffering would be saved, and consider what a
multitude of human nuisances would he "moved
on!"</p>

<p>The poor have a saying that none live long after
they have been in a certain hospital. "He's been
in that hospital&mdash;he won't live long." They carry
out such wonderful operations there&mdash;human vivisections,
but strictly painless, of course, under
chloroform&mdash;true Christian chopping-up&mdash;still the
folk do not live long when they come out.</p>

<p>Why not set up the Apparatus? But a man
must not die in peace. Starvation is for human
nuisances.</p>

<p>These rich folk dwelling round about the great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Babylon of Misery, where Want sits on the Seven
Hills, have also distinguished themselves by yet
another invention. This is the organization of
alms. Charity is so holy we will not leave it to
chance&mdash;to the stray penny&mdash;we will organize it.
The system is very simple: it is done by ticket.
First you subscribe a few shillings to some organization,
with its secretary, its clerks, its offices,
board-room, and "machinery." For this you receive
tickets.</p>

<p>If a disagreeable woman with a baby in her arms,
or a ragged boy, or a maimed man asks you for a
"copper," you hand him a ticket. This saves
trouble and responsibility.</p>

<p>The beggar can take the ticket to the "office"
and get his case "investigated." After an inquiry,
and an adjournment for a week; another inquiry,
and another adjournment for a week; a third inquiry,
and a third adjournment, then, if he be of
high moral character and highly recommended, he
may get his dinner.</p>

<p>One great advantage is conspicuous in this system:
by no possible means can you risk giving a
penny to a man not of high moral character, though
he be perishing of starvation.</p>

<p>If a man asks for bread, will ye give him a stone?
Certainly not; give him a ticket.</p>

<p>They did not understand how to do things in
Judea Anno Domini I.</p>

<p>This organization of charity saves such a lot of
money: where people used to give away five pounds
they now pay five shillings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>Nothing like saving money. And, besides, you
walk about with a clear conscience. No matter
how many maimed men, or disagreeable women, or
ragged boys you see, you can stroll on comfortably
and never think about them; your charity is organized.</p>

<p>If the German thinkers had not found out twenty
years ago that there was no Devil, one would be
inclined to ascribe this spurious, lying, false, and
abominable mockery to the direct instigation of a
Satan.</p>

<p>The organization of charity! The very nature
of charity is spontaneousness.</p>

<p>You should have heard Alere lash out about this
business; he called it charity suppression.</p>

<p>Have you ever seen London in the early winter
morning, when the frost lies along the kerb, just
melting as the fires are lit; cold, grey, bitter, stony
London?</p>

<p>Whatever <i>can</i> morning seem like to the starved
and chilly wretches who have slept on the floor, and
wake up to frost in Fleet Street?</p>

<p>The pavements are covered with expectoration,
indicating the chest diseases and misery that thousands
are enduring. But I must not write too
plainly; it would offend.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX.</h2>


<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/a.png" width="120" height="120" alt="A" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'> PRINTER in the office crawled under
the bed of the machine to replace something&mdash;a
nut that had dropped; it was
not known that he was there; the
crank came round and crushed him
against the brickwork. The embrace of iron is death.</div>

<p>Alere fed his helpless children, and apprenticed
them when they were old enough.</p>

<p>Ten pounds was enough for him&mdash;without ambition,
and without business-avarice; ten pounds
was enough for his Fleet Street life.</p>

<p>It was not only the actual money he gave away,
but the kindness of the man. Have you ever
noticed the boys who work in printing-offices?&mdash;their
elbows seem so sharp and pointed, bony, and
without flesh. Instead of the shirt-sleeve being
turned up, it looks as if the pointed elbow had
thrust its way through.</p>

<p>He always had something for them;&mdash;a plate of
beef, soup, beer to be shared, apples, baked potatoes,
now and then half-a-dozen mild cigars. Awful
this, was it not? Printers' boys <i>will</i> smoke; they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
had better have Flamma's fine tobacco than the vile
imitation they buy.</p>

<p>They always had a tale for him; either their
mothers, or sisters, or some one was in trouble;
Flamma was certain to do something, however little
might be within his power. At least he went to
see.</p>

<p>Had a man an income of a million he could not
relieve the want of London; the wretch relieved to-day
needs again to-morrow. But Alere went to see.</p>

<p>Ten pounds did much in the shaky hands of a
man without ambition, and without business-avarice,
who went to see the unfortunate.</p>

<p>His own palsied mother, at the verge of life,
looked to Alere for all that the son can do for the
parent. Other sons seemed more capable of such
duty; yet it invariably fell upon Alere. He was
the Man. And for those little luxuries and comforts
that soothe the dull hours of trembling age she
depended entirely upon him.</p>

<p>So you see the ten-pound notes that satisfied
him were not all spent in drink.</p>

<p>But alas! once now and then the rats began to
run up the wall in broad daylight, and foolish Alere,
wise in this one thing, immediately began to pack
his carpet-bag. He put in his collars, his slippers,
his sketch-books and pencils, some of his engraving
tools, and a few blocks of boxwood, his silver-mounted
flute, and a book for Amaryllis. He
packed his carpet-bag and hastened away to his
Baden-Baden, to Coombe Oaks, his spa among the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
apple-bloom, the song of finches, and rustle of
leaves.</p>

<p>They sat and talked in the round summer-house in
Iden's garden, with the summer unfolding at their
knees; Amaryllis, Amadis, Iden, and Flamma.</p>

<p>By Flamma's side there stood a great mug of
the Goliath ale, and between his lips there was a
long churchwarden pipe.</p>

<p>The Goliath ale was his mineral water; his
gaseous, alkaline, chalybeate liquor; better by far
than Kissingen, Homburg, Vichy; better by far
than mud baths and hot springs. There is no
medicine in nature, or made by man, like good ale.
He who drinks ale is strong.</p>

<p>The bitter principle of the aromatic hops went to
his nervous system, to the much-suffering liver, to
the clogged and weary organs, bracing and stimulating,
urging on, vitalizing anew.</p>

<p>The spirit drawn from the joyous barley warmed
his heart; a cordial grown on the sunny hill-side,
watered with dew and sweet rain, coloured by the
light, a liquor of sunshine, potable sunbeam.</p>

<p>Age mingling hops and barley in that just and
equitable proportion, no cunning of hand, no
science can achieve, gave to it the vigour of years,
the full manhood of strength.</p>

<p>There was in it an alchemic power analysis cannot
define. The chemist analyzes, and he finds of
ten parts, there are this and there are that, and the
residue is "volatile principle," for which all the
dictionaries of science have no explanation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span></p>

<p>"Volatile principle"&mdash;there it is, that is the
secret. That is the life of the thing; by no
possible means can you obtain that volatile principle&mdash;that
alchemic force&mdash;except contained in genuine
old ale.</p>

<p>Only it must be genuine, and it must be old;
such as Iden brewed.</p>

<p>The Idens had been famous for ale for generations.</p>

<p>By degrees Alere's hand grew less shaky; the
glass ceased to chink against his teeth; the strong,
good ale was setting his Fleet Street liver in order.</p>

<p>You have "liver," you have "dyspepsia," you
have "kidneys," you have "abdominal glands," and
the doctor tells you you must take bitters, <i>i.e.</i>,
quassia, buchu, gentian, cascarilla, calumba; aperients
and diluents, podophyllin, taraxacum, salts;
physic for the nerves and blood, quinine, iron,
phosphorus; this is but the briefest outline of your
draughts and preparations; add to it for various
purposes, liquor arsenicalis, bromide of potassium,
strychnia, belladonna.</p>

<p>Weary and disappointed, you turn to patent
medicines&mdash;American and French patent physic is
very popular now&mdash;and find the same things precisely
under taking titles, enormously advertised.</p>

<p>It is a fact that nine out of ten of the medicines
compounded are intended to produce exactly the
same effects as are caused by a few glasses of good
old ale. The objects are to set the great glands in
motion, to regulate the stomach, brace the nerves,
and act as a tonic and cordial; a little ether put in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
to aid the digestion of the compound. This is
precisely what good old ale does, and digests itself
very comfortably. Above all things, it contains
the volatile principle, which the prescriptions have
not got.</p>

<p>Many of the compounds actually are beer, bittered
with quassia instead of hops; made nauseous in
order that you may have faith in them.</p>

<p>"Throw physic to the dogs," get a cask of the
true Goliath, and "<i>drenk un down to the therd hoop</i>."</p>

<p>Long before Alere had got to the first hoop the
rats ceased to run up the wall, his hand became less
shaky, he began to play a very good knife and fork
at the bacon and Iden's splendid potatoes; by-and-by
he began to hum old German songs.</p>

<p>But you may ask, how do <i>you</i> know, you're not a
doctor, you're a mere story-spinner, you're no
authority? I reply that I am in a position to know
much more than a doctor.</p>

<p>How can that be?</p>

<p>Because I have been a Patient. It is so much
easier to be a doctor than a patient. The doctor
imagines what his prescriptions are like and what
they will do; he imagines, but the Patient <i>knows</i>.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'>OME noble physicians have tried the
effect of drugs upon themselves in
order to advance their art; for this
they have received Gold Medals, and are
alluded to as Benefactors of Mankind.</div>

<p>I have tried the effects of forty prescriptions
upon My Person. With the various combinations,
patent medicines, and so forth, the total would, I
verily believe, reach eighty drugs.</p>

<p>Consequently, it is clear I ought to receive eighty
gold medals. I am a Benefactor eighty times multiplied;
the incarnation of virtue; a sort of Buddha,
kiss my knees, ye slaves!</p>

<p>I have a complaisant feeling as I walk about
that I have thus done more good than any man
living.</p>

<p>I am still very ill.</p>

<p>The curious things an invalid is gravely recommended
to try! One day I was sitting in that
great cosmopolitan museum, the waiting-room at
Charing Cross station, wearily glancing from time
to time at the clock, and reckoning how long it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
would be before I could get home. There is nothing
so utterly tiring to the enfeebled as an interview
with a London physician. So there I sat, huddled
of a heap, quite knocked up, and, I suppose, must
have coughed from time to time. By-and-by, a
tall gentleman came across the room and sat down
beside me. "I hope I don't intrude," said he, in
American accents. "I was obliged to come and
speak to you&mdash;you look bad. I <i>hate</i> to hear
anybody cough." He put an emphasis on hate, a
long-drawn nasal <i>haate</i>, hissing it out with unmeasured
ferocity. "I <i>haate</i> to hear anybody
cough. Now I should like to tell you how to cure
it, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"By all means&mdash;very interesting," I replied.</p>

<p>"I was bad at home, in the States," said he.
"I was on my back four years with a cough. I
couldn't do anything&mdash;couldn't help myself; four
years, and I got down to eighty-seven pounds.
That's a fact, I weighed eighty-seven pounds."</p>

<p>"Very little," I said, looking him over; he was
tall and broad-shouldered, not very thick, a square-set
man.</p>

<p>"I tried everything the doctors recommended&mdash;it
was no use; they had to give me up. At last a
man cured me; and how do you think he did
it?"</p>

<p>"Can't think&mdash;should much like to know."</p>

<p>"Crude petroleum," said the American. "That
was it. Crude petroleum! You take it just as it
comes from the wells; not refined, mind. Just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
crude. Ten drops on a bit of sugar three times a
day, before meals. Taste it? No, not to speak
of; you don't mind it after a little while. I had
in a ten-gallon keg. I got well. I got up to two
hundred and fifty pounds. That's true. I got too
fat, had to check it. But I take the drops still, if
I feel out of sorts. Guess I'm strong enough now.
Been all over Europe."</p>

<p>I looked at him again; certainly, he did appear
strong enough.</p>

<p>"But you Britishers won't try anything, I suppose,
from the States, now."</p>

<p>I hastened to assure him I had no prejudice of
that sort&mdash;if it would cure me, it might come from
anywhere.</p>

<p>"You begin with five drops," he said, solemnly.
"Or three, if you like, and work up to ten. It
soon gets easy to take. You'll soon pick up. But
I doubt if you'll get a keg of the crude oil in
this country; you'll have to send over for it. I
<i>haate</i> to hear anybody cough"&mdash;and so we
parted.</p>

<p>He was so much in earnest, that if I had egged
him on, I verily believe he would have got the keg
for me himself. It seemed laughable at the time;
but I don't laugh now. I almost think that good-natured
American was right; he certainly meant
well.</p>

<p>Crude petroleum! Could anything be more
nauseous? But probably it acts as a kind of cod-liver
oil. Sometimes I wish I had tried it. Like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
him, I hate to hear anybody cough! Better take
a ten-gallon keg of petroleum.</p>

<p>Alere's crude petroleum was the Goliath ale, and
he had hardly begun to approach the first hoop,
when, as I tell you, he was heard to hum old German
songs; it was the volatile principle.</p>

<p>Songs about the Pope and the Sultan</p>

<div class='poem'>
But yet he's not a happy man,<br />
He must obey the Alcoran,<br />
He dares not touch one drop of wine,<br />
I'm glad the Sultan's lot's not mine.<br />
</div>

<p>Songs about the rat that dwelt in the cellar, and
fed on butter till he raised a paunch that would
have done credit to Luther; songs about a King in
Thule and the cup his mistress gave him, a beautiful
old song that, none like it&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>

</div>

<p>Or his thought slipped back to his school-days,
and beating the seat in the summer-house with his
hand for time, Alere ran on:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>

<p>Days of Valpy the Vulture, eating the schoolboy's
heart out, Eton Latin grammar, accidence&mdash;do
<i>not</i> pause, traveller, if you see <i>his</i> tomb!</p>

<p>"Play to me," said Amaryllis, and the Fleet-Street
man put away his pipe, and took up his
flute; he breathed soft and low&mdash;an excellent
thing in a musician&mdash;delicious airs of Mozart
chiefly.</p>

<p>The summer unfolded itself at their knees, the
high buttercups of the meadow came to the very
door, the apple-bloom poured itself out before
them; music all of it, music in colour, in light, in
flowers, in song of happy birds. The soothing
flute strung together the flow of their thoughts,
they were very silent, Amaryllis and Amadis Iden&mdash;almost
hand in hand&mdash;listening to his cunning
lips.</p>

<p>He ceased, and they were still silent, listening to
their own hearts.</p>

<p>The starlings flew by every few minutes to their
nests in the thatch of the old house, and out again
to the meadow.</p>

<p>Alere showed how impossible it was to draw a
bird in flight by the starling's wings. His wings
beat up and down so swiftly that the eye had not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
time to follow them completely; they formed a burr&mdash;an
indistinct flutter; you are supposed to see
the starling flying from you. The lifted tips were
depressed so quickly that the impression of them
in the raised position had not time to fade from the
eye before a fresh impression arrived exhibiting them
depressed to their furthest extent; you thus saw the
wings in both positions, up and down, at once. A
capital letter X may roughly represent his idea; the
upper part answers to the wings lifted, the lower
part to the wings down, and you see both together.
Further, in actual fact, you see the wings in innumerable
other positions between these two extremes;
like the leaves of a book opened with your
thumb quickly&mdash;as they do in legerdemain&mdash;almost
as you see the spokes of a wheel run together as
they revolve&mdash;a sort of burr.</p>

<p>To produce an image of a starling flying, you
must draw all this.</p>

<p>The swift feathers are almost liquid; they leave
a streak behind in the air like a meteor.</p>

<p>Thus the genial Goliath ale renewed the very
blood in Alere's veins.</p>

<p>Amaryllis saw too that the deadly paleness of
Amadis Iden's cheeks&mdash;absolute lack of blood&mdash;began
to give way to the faintest colour, little more
than the delicate pink of the apple-bloom, though
he could take hardly a wine-glass of Goliath. If
you threw a wine-glassful of the Goliath on the
hearth it blazed up the chimney in the most lively<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
manner. Fire in it&mdash;downright fire! That is the
test.</p>

<p>Amadis could scarcely venture on a wine-glassful,
yet a faint pink began to steal into his face, and
his white lips grew moist. He drank deeply of
another cup.</p>

</div><div class='unindent'>ET me try," said Amadis, taking the
handle of the churn from Jearje. The
butter was obstinate, and would not
come; it was eleven o'clock in the
morning, and still there was the rattle
of milk in the barrel, the sound of a liquid splashing
over and over. By the sounds Mrs. Iden knew
that the fairies were in the churn. Jearje had
been turning for hours.</div>

<p>Amadis stooped to the iron handle, polished like
silver by Jearje's rough hands&mdash;a sort of skin sand-paper&mdash;and
with an effort made the heavy blue-painted barrel
revolve on its axis.</p>

<p>Mrs. Iden, her sleeves up, looked from the dairy
window into the court where the churn stood.</p>

<p>"Ah, it's no use your trying," she said, "you'll
only tire yourself."</p>

<p>Jearje, glad to stand upright a minute, said,
"First-rate, measter."</p>

<p>Amaryllis cried, "Take care; you'd better not,
you'll hurt yourself."</p>

<p>"Aw!&mdash;aw!" laughed Bill Nye, who was sitting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
on a form by the wall under the dairy window. He
was waiting to see Iden about the mowing. "Aw!&mdash;aw!
Look 'ee thur, now!"</p>

<p>Heavily the blue barrel went round&mdash;thrice, four
times, five times; the colour mounted into Amadis's
cheeks, not so much from the labour as the unwonted
stooping; his breath came harder; he
had to desist, and go and sit down on the form
beside Bill Nye.</p>

<p>"I wish you would not do it," said Amaryllis.
"You know you're not strong yet." She spoke as
if she had been his mother or his nurse, somewhat
masterfully and reproachfully.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid I'm not," said poor Amadis. His
chin fell and his face lengthened&mdash;his eyes grew
larger&mdash;his temples pinched; disappointment wrung
at his heart.</p>

<p>Convalescence is like walking in sacks; a short
waddle and a fall.</p>

<p>"I can tell 'ee of a vine thing, measter," said
Bill Nye, "as I knows on; you get a pint measure
full of snails&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"There, do hold your tongue, it's enough to
make anyone ill to think of," said Amaryllis, angrily,
and Bill was silent as to the cod-liver oil virtues of
snails. Amaryllis went to fetch a glass of milk for
Amadis.</p>

<p>A robin came into the court, and perching on
the edge of a tub, fluttered his wings, cried "Check,
check," "Anything for me this morning?" and so
put his head on one side, languishing and persuasive.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>

<p>"My sister, as was in a decline, used to have
snail-oil rubbed into her back," said Luce, the
maid, who had been standing in the doorway with
a duster.</p>

<p>"A pretty state of things," cried Mrs. Hen, in a
passion. "You standing there doing nothing, and
it's butter-making morning, and everything behind,
and you idling and talking,"&mdash;rushing out from the
dairy, and following Luce, who retreated indoors.</p>

<p>"Hur'll catch it," said Bill Nye.</p>

<p>"Missis is &mdash;&mdash;" said Jearje, supplying the
blank with a wink, and meaning in a temper this
morning. "Missis," like all nervous people, was
always in a fury about nothing when her mind was
intent on an object; in this case, the butter.</p>

<p>"Here's eleven o'clock," she cried, in the sitting-room,
pointing to the clock, "and the beds ain't
made."</p>

<p>"I've made the beds," said stolid Luce.</p>

<p>"And the fire isn't dusted up."</p>

<p>"I've dusted up the fire."</p>

<p>"And you're a lazy slut"&mdash;pushing Luce about
the room.</p>

<p>"I bean't a lazy slut."</p>

<p>"You haven't touched the mantelpiece; give
me the duster!"&mdash;snatching it from her.</p>

<p>"He be done."</p>

<p>"All you can do is to stand and talk with the
men. There's no water taken up stairs."</p>

<p>"That there be."</p>

<p>"You know you ought to be doing something;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
the lazy lot of people in this house; I never saw
anything like it; there's Mr. Iden's other boots to be
cleaned, and there's the parlour to be swept, and the
path to be weeded, and the things to be taken over
for washing, and the teapot ought to go in to Woolhorton,
you know the lid's loose, and the children
will be here in a minute for the scraps, and your
master will be in to lunch, and there's not a soul to
help me in the least," and so, flinging the duster at
Luce, out she flew into the court, and thence into
the kitchen, where she cut a great slice of bread
and cheese, and drew a quart of ale, and took them
out to Bill Nye.</p>

<p>"Aw, thank'ee m'm," said Bill, from the very
depth of his chest, and set to work happily.</p>

<p>Next, she drew a mug for Jearje, who held it
with one hand and sipped, while he turned with
the other; his bread and cheese he ate in like
manner, he could not wait till he had finished the
churning.</p>

<p>"Verily, man is made up of impatience," said
the angel Gabriel in the Koran, as you no doubt
remember; Adam was made of clay (who was the
sculptor's ghost that modelled him?) and when the
breath of life was breathed into him, he rose on his
arm and began to eat before his lower limbs were
yet vivified. This is a fact. "Verily, man is made
up of impatience." As the angel had never had a
stomach or anything to sit upon, as the French say,
he need not have made so unkind a remark; if he
had had a stomach and a digestion like Bill Nye and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Jearje, it is certain he would never have wanted to
be an angel.</p>

<p>Next, there were four cottage children now in
the court, waiting for scraps.</p>

<p>Mrs. Iden, bustling to and fro like a whirlwind,
swept the poor little things into the kitchen and
filled two baskets for them with slices of bread and
butter, squares of cheese, a beef bone, half a rabbit,
a dish of cold potatoes, two bottles of beer from the
barrel, odds and ends, and so swept them off again
in a jiffy.</p>

<p>Mrs. Iden! Mrs. Iden! you ought to be ashamed
of yourself, that is not the way to feed the poor.
What <i>could</i> you be thinking of, you ignorant
farmer's wife!</p>

<p>You should go to London, Mrs. Iden, and join a
Committee with duchesses and earlesses, and wives
of rich City tradesfolk; much more important
these than the duchesses, they will teach you manners.
They will teach you how to feed the poor
with the help of the Rev. Joseph Speechify, and
the scientific Dr. Am&oelig;ba Bacillus; Joe has Providence
at his fingers' ends, and guides it in the
right way; Bacillus knows everything to a particle;
with Providence and Science together they <i>must</i>
do it properly.</p>

<p>The scientific dinner for the poor must be composed
of the principles of food in the right proportion:
(1) Albuminates, (2) Hydro-Carbons, (3)
Carbo-hydrates. Something juicy coming now!</p>

<p>The scientific dinner consists of haricot beans, or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
lentil soup, or oatmeal porridge, or vegetable pot-bouilli;
say twopence a quart. They can get all
the proteids out of that, and lift the requisite
foot-tons.</p>

<p>No wasteful bread and butter, no scandalous
cheese, no abominable beef bone, no wretched rabbit,
no prodigal potatoes, above all, No immoral ale!</p>

<p>There, Mrs. Iden.</p>

<p>Go to the famous Henry Ward Beecher, that
shining light and apostle, Mrs. Iden, and read,
mark, learn, and inwardly digest what he says:&mdash;</p>

<p>"A man who cannot live on bread is not fit to
live. A family may live, laugh, love and be happy
that eats bread in the morning with good water,
and water and good bread at noon, and water and
bread at night."</p>

<p>Does that sound like an echo of the voice that
ceased on the Cross?</p>

<p>Guilty Mrs Iden, ignorant farmer's wife; hide
your beef and ale, your rabbit and potatoes.</p>

<p>To duchesses and earlesses, and plump City
ladies riding in carriages, and all such who eat
and drink five times a day, and have six or eight
courses at dinner, doubtless once now and then a
meal of vegetable pot-bouilli, or oatmeal porridge,
or lentil soup (three halfpence a pound lentils), or
haricot beans and water would prove a scientifically
wholesome thing.</p>

<p>But to those who exist all the week on hunches
of dry bread, and not much of that, oatmeal porridge
doesn't seem to come as a luxury. They would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
like something juicy; good rumpsteak now, with
plenty of rich gravy, broad slices from legs of
mutton, and foaming mugs of ale. They need something
to put fresh blood and warmth into them.</p>

<p>You sometimes hear people remark: "How
strange it is&mdash;the poor never buy oatmeal, or
lentils!"</p>

<p>Of course they don't; if by any chance they do
get a shilling to spend, they like a mutton chop.
They have enough of farinaceous fare.</p>

<p>What Mrs. Iden ought to have done had she
been scientific, was to have given each of these
poor hungry children a nicely printed little pamphlet,
teaching them how to cook.</p>

<p>Instead of which, she set all their teeth going;
infinitely wicked Mrs. Iden!</p>

said Amaryllis, masterfully, as Amadis
lingered over the glass of milk she had
brought him. He had but half finished
it; she insisted, "Come, drink it all."
Amadis made an effort, and obeyed.</div>

<p>But his heart was bitter as absinthe.</p>

<p>Everyone else was strong, and hardy, and manly;
even the women were manly, they could eat and
drink.</p>

<p>Rough-headed Jearje, at the churn, ate hard
cheese, and drank ale, and turned the crank at the
same time.</p>

<p>Round-headed Bill Nye sat on the form, happily
munching cheese, oh so happily! Gabriel (of the
Koran) would never believe how happily, sipping
his tall quart-mug.</p>

<p>Mrs. Iden bustled to and fro, for all her fifty
years, more energetic than all the hamlet put together.</p>

<p>Luce, the maid, had worked since six, and would
go on hours longer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>

<p>Alere Flamma was smoking and sipping Goliath
ale in the summer-house; he could eat, and drink,
and walk about as a man should.</p>

<p>Amaryllis was as strong as a young lioness; he
had seen her turn the heavy cheese-tub round as if
it were a footstool.</p>

<p>He alone was weak, pale, contemptible; unable
to eat strong meat; unable to drink strong drink;
put down to sip milk as an infant; unable to walk
farther than Plum Corner in the garden; unable to
ride even; a mere shadow, a thing of contempt.</p>

<p>They told him he was better. There was just a
trifle of pink in his face, and he could walk to Plum
Corner in the garden without clinging to Amaryllis's
arm, or staying to steady himself and get his balance
more than three or four times. He had even ventured
a little way up the meadow-path, but it made
him giddy to stoop to pick a buttercup. They
told him he was better; he could eat a very little
more, and sip a wine-glassful of Goliath.</p>

<p>Better! What a mockery to a man who could
once row, and ride, and shoot, and walk his thirty
miles, and play his part in any sport you chose!
It was absinthe to him.</p>

<p>He could not stoop to turn the churn&mdash;he had
to sip milk in the presence of strong men drinking
strong drink; to be despised; the very servant-maid
talking of him as in a decline.</p>

<p>And before Amaryllis; before whom he wished
to appear a man.</p>

<p>And full of ideas, too; he felt that he had ideas,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
that he could think, yet he could scarce set one
foot safely before the other, not without considering
first and feeling his way.</p>

<p>Rough-headed Jearje, without a thought, was as
strong as the horses he led in the waggon.</p>

<p>Round-headed Bill Nye, without an idea, could
mow all day in the heat of July.</p>

<p>He, with all his ideas, his ambitions, his exalted
hopes, his worship of Amaryllis&mdash;he was nothing.
Less than nothing&mdash;a shadow.</p>

<p>To despise oneself is more bitter than absinthe.</p>

<p>Let us go to Al Hariri once again, and hear what
he says. The speaker has been very, very ill, but
is better:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And he prostrated himself long in prayer: then raised
his head, and said:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class='poem2'>
"Despair not in calamities of a gladdening that shall wipe away thy sorrows;<br />
For how many a simoom blows, then turns to a gentle breeze, and is changed!<br />
How many a hateful cloud arises, then passes away, and pours not forth!<br />
And the smoke of the wood, fear is conceived of it, yet no blaze appears from it;<br />
And oft sorrow rises, and straightway sets again.<br />
So be patient when fear assails, for Time is the Father of Wonders;<br />
And hope from the peace of God blessings not to be reckoned!"<br />
</div>

<p>How should such a chant as this enter a young
man's heart who felt himself despicable in the sight
of his mistress?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span></p>

<p>"Should you like a little more?" asked Amaryllis,
in a very gentle tone, now he had obeyed her.</p>

<p>"I would rather not," said Amadis, still hanging
his head.</p>

<p>His days were mixed of honey and wormwood;
sweet because of Amaryllis, absinthe because of his
weakness.</p>

<p>A voice came from the summer-house; Flamma
was shouting an old song, with heavy emphasis
here and there, with big capital letters:&mdash;</p>

<div class='poem'>
The jolly old Sun, where goes he at night?<br />
And what does he Do, when he's out of Sight?<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">All Insinuation Scorning;</span><br />
I don't mean to Say that he Tipples apace,<br />
I only Know he's a very Red Face<br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">When he gets up in the Morning!</span><br />
</div>

<p>"Haw! Haw! Haw!" laughed Bill Nye, with
his mouth full. "Th' zun do look main red in the
marning, surely."</p>

<p>They heard the front door open and shut; Iden
had come in for his lunch, and, by the sound of the
footsteps, had brought one of his gossips with
him.</p>

<p>At this Mrs. Iden began to ruffle up her feathers
for battle.</p>

<p>Iden came through into the dairy.</p>

<p>"Now, you ain't wanted here," she said. "Poking
your nose into everything. Wonder you don't
help Luce make the beds and sweep the floor!"</p>

<p>"Can I help'ee?" said Iden, soothingly. "Want
any wood for the fire&mdash;or anything?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span></p>

<p>"As if Luce couldn't fetch the wood&mdash;and chop
it, as well as you. Why can't you mind your business?
Here's Bill Nye been waiting these two
hours to see you"&mdash;following Iden towards the
sitting-room. "Who have you brought in with
you now? Of course, everybody comes in of a
butter-making morning, just the busiest time!
Oh! it's you! Sit still, Mr. Duck; I don't mind
<i>you</i>. What will you take?"</p>

<p>More ale and cheese here, too; Iden and Jack
Duck sat in the bow-window and went at their
lunch. So soon as they were settled, out flounced
Mrs. Iden into the dairy: "The lazy lot of people
in this house&mdash;I never saw anything like it!"</p>

<p>It was true.</p>

<p>There was Alere Flamma singing in the summer-house;
Amadis Iden resting on the form; Amaryllis
standing by him; Bill Nye munching;
Jearje indolently rotating the churn with one hand,
and feeding himself with the other; Luce sitting
down to her lunch in the kitchen; Iden lifting his
mug in the bow-window; Jack Duck with his great
mouth full; eight people&mdash;and four little children
trotting down the road with baskets of food.</p>

<p>"The lazy lot of people in this house; I never
saw anything like it."</p>

<p>And that was the beauty of the place, the "Let
us not trouble ourselves;" "a handful in Peace and
Quiet" is better than set banquets; crumbs for
everybody, and for the robin too; "God listens to
those who pray to him. Let us eat, and drink, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
think of nothing;" believe me, the plain plenty,
and the rest, and peace, and sunshine of an old
farmhouse, there is nothing like it in this world!</p>

<p>"I never saw anything like it. Nothing done;
nothing done; the morning gone and nothing done;
and the butter's not come yet!"</p>

<p>Homer is thought much of; now, his heroes are
always eating. They eat all through the Iliad, they
eat at Patroclus' tomb; Ulysses eats a good deal
in the Odyssey: Jupiter eats. They only did at
Coombe-Oaks as was done on Olympus.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 120px;">
<img src="images/a.png" width="120" height="120" alt="A" title="" />
</div><div class='unindent'>MARYLLIS went outside the court,
and waited; Amadis rose and followed
her. "Come a little way into the
Brook-Field," she said.</div>

<p>They left the apple-bloom behind
them, and going down the gravel-path passed the
plum trees&mdash;the daffodils there were over now&mdash;by
the strawberry patch which Iden had planted under
the parlour window; by the great box-hedge where
a thrush sat on her nest undisturbed, though Amaryllis's
dress brushed the branches; by the espalier
apple, to the little orchard-gate.</p>

<p>The parlour-window&mdash;there are no parlours now,
except in old country houses; there were parlours
in the days of Queen Anne; in the modern villas
they have drawing-rooms.</p>

<p>The parlour-window hung over with pear-tree
branches, planted beneath with strawberry; white
blossom above, white flower beneath; birds' nests
in the branches of the pear&mdash;that was Iden.</p>

<p>They opened the little orchard-gate which pushed
heavily against the tall meadow-grass growing between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
the bars. The path was almost gone&mdash;grown
out with grass, and as they moved they left a broad
trail behind them.</p>

<p>Bill Nye the mower, had he seen, would have
muttered to himself; they were trespassing on his
mowing-grass, trampling it, and making it more
difficult to cut.</p>

<p>Her dress swept over the bennets and shook the
thick-stemmed butter-cups&mdash;branched like the
golden candlestick, and with flowers of golden flame.
For the burnished petals reflect the sun, and throw
light back into the air.</p>

<p>Amadis began to drag behind&mdash;he could not
walk much farther; they sat down together on the
trunk of an oak that had been felled by a gateway
close to the horse-chestnut trees Iden had planted.
Even with his back leaning against a limb of the
oak, Amadis had to partly support himself with his
hands.</p>

<p>What was the use of such a man?&mdash;He had
nothing but his absurdly romantic name from Don
Quixote to recommend him.</p>

<p>That was the very thought that gnawed at poor
Amadis's heart as he sat by her side. What use to
care for him?</p>

<p>Iden's flag-basket of tools lay by the gate, it was
a new gate, and he had been fitting it before he
went in to lunch. His basket was of flag because
the substance of the flag is soft, and the tools,
chisels, and so on, laid pleasant in it; he must have
everything right. The new gate was of solid oak,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
no "sappy" stuff, real heart of oak, well-seasoned,
without a split, fine, close-grained timber, cut on the
farm, and kept till it was thoroughly fit, genuine
English oak. If you would only consider Iden's
gate you might see there the man.</p>

<p>This gateway was only between two meadows,
and the ordinary farmer, when the old gate wore
out, would have stopped it with a couple of rails, or
a hurdle or two, something very, very cheap and
rough; at most a gate knocked up by the village
carpenter of ash and willow, at the lowest possible
charge.</p>

<p>Iden could not find a carpenter good enough to
make <i>his</i> gate in the hamlet; he sent for one ten
miles, and paid him full carpenter's wages. He
was not satisfied then, he watched the man at his
work to see that the least little detail was done
correctly, till the fellow would have left the job,
had he not been made pliable by the Goliath ale.
So he just stretched the job out as long as he
could, and talked and talked with Iden, and stroked
him the right way, and drank the ale, and "played
it upon me and on William, That day in a way I
despise." Till what with the planing, and shaving,
and smoothing, and morticing, and ale, and time,
it footed up a pretty bill, enough for three commonplace
gates, not of the Iden style.</p>

<p>Why, Iden had put away those pieces of timber
years before for this very purpose, and had watched
the sawyers saw them out at the pit. They would
have made good oak furniture. There was nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
special or particular about this gateway; he had
done the same in turn for every gateway on the
farm; it was the Iden way.</p>

<p>A splendid gate it was, when it was finished, fit
for a nobleman's Home Park. I doubt, if you
would find such a gate, so well proportioned, and
made of such material on any great estate in the
kingdom. For not even dukes can get an Iden to
look after their property. An Iden is not to be
"picked up," I can tell you.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood round about had always
sneered in the broad country way at Iden's
gates. "Vit for m' Lard's park. What do <i>he</i>
want wi' such geates? A' ain't a got no cattle
to speak on; any ould rail ud do as good as thuck
geat."</p>

<p>The neighbourhood round about could never
understand Iden, never could see why he had gone
to such great trouble to render the homestead
beautiful with trees, why he had re-planted the
orchard with pleasant eating apples in the place of
the old cider apples, hard and sour. "Why
wouldn't thaay a' done for he as well as for we?"</p>

<p>All the acts of Iden seemed to the neighbourhood
to be the acts of a "vool."</p>

<p>When he cut a hedge, for instance, Iden used to
have the great bushes that bore unusually fine May
bloom saved from the billhook, that they might
flower in the spring. So, too, with the crab-apples&mdash;for
the sake of the white blossom; so, too, with
the hazel&mdash;for the nuts.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>But what caused the most "wonderment" was
the planting of the horse-chestnuts in the corner of
the meadow? Whatever did he want with horse-chestnuts?
No other horse-chestnuts grew about
there. You couldn't eat the horse-chestnuts when
they dropped in autumn.</p>

<p>In truth Iden built for all time, and not for the
little circumstance of the hour. His gate was
meant to last for years, rain and shine, to endure
any amount of usage, to be a work of Art in
itself.</p>

<p>His gate as the tangible symbol of his mind&mdash;was
at once his strength and his folly. His
strength, for it was such qualities as these that
made Old England famous, and set her on the firm
base whereon she now stands&mdash;built for all Time.
His folly, because he made too much of little things,
instead of lifting his mind higher.</p>

<p>If only he could have lived three hundred years
the greater world would have begun to find out
Iden and to idolize him, and make pilgrimages
from over sea to Coombe Oaks, to hear him talk,
for Iden could talk of the trees and grass, and all
that the Earth bears, as if one had conversed face
to face with the great god Pan himself.</p>

<p>But while Iden slumbered with his head against
the panel&mdash;think, think, think&mdash;this shallow world
of ours, this petty threescore years and ten, was
slipping away. Already Amaryllis had marked
with bitterness at heart the increasing stoop of the
strong back.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>Iden was like the great engineer who could
never build a bridge, because he knew so well how
a bridge ought to be built.</p>

<p>"Such a fuss over a mess of a gate," said Mrs.
Iden, "making yourself ridiculous: I believe that
carpenter is just taking advantage of you. Why
can't you go into town and see your father?&mdash;it
would be a hundred pounds in your pocket"&mdash;as it
would have been, no doubt. If only Mrs. Iden had
gone about her lecture in a pleasanter manner perhaps
he would have taken her advice.</p>

<p>Resting upon the brown timber in the grass
Amaryllis and Amadis could just see a corner of
the old house through the spars of the new gate.
Coombe Oaks was a grown house, if you understand;
a house that had grown in the course of
many generations, not built to set order; it had
grown like a tree that adapts itself to circumstances,
and, therefore, like the tree it was beautiful
to look at. There were windows in deep notches,
between gables where there was no look-out except
at the pears on the wall, awkward windows, quite
bewildering. A workman came to mend one one
day, and could not get at it. "Darned if I ever
seed such a crooked picter of a house!" said
he.</p>

<p>A kingfisher shot across above the golden surface
of the buttercups, straight for the brook,
moving, as it seemed, without wings, so swiftly did
he vibrate them, that only his azure hue was visible,
drawn like a line of peacock blue over the gold.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>

<p>In the fitness of things Amaryllis ought not to
have been sitting there like this, with Amadis lost
in the sweet summer dream of love.</p>

<p>She ought to have loved and married a Launcelot
du Lake, a hero of the mighty arm, only with
the income of Sir Gorgius Midas: that is the
proper thing.</p>

<p>But the fitness of things never comes to pass&mdash;everything
happens in the Turkish manner.</p>

<p>Here was Amaryllis, very strong and full of life,
very, very young and inexperienced, very poor and
without the least expectation whatever (for who
could reconcile the old and the older Iden?), the
daughter of poor and embarrassed parents, whom
she wished and prayed to help in their coming old
age. Here was Amaryllis, full of poetic feeling
and half a painter at heart, full of generous sentiments&mdash;what
a nature to be ground down in the
sordidness of married poverty!</p>

<p>Here was Amadis, extremely poor, quite feeble,
and unable to earn a shilling, just talking of seeing
the doctor again about this fearful debility, full too,
as he thought at least, of ideas&mdash;what a being to
think of her!</p>

<p>Nothing ever happens in the fitness of things.
If only now he could have regained the health and
strength of six short months ago&mdash;if only that,
but you see, he had not even that. He might get
better; true&mdash;he <i>might</i>, I have tried 80 drugs and
I am no better, I hope he will.</p>

<p>Could any blundering Sultan in the fatalistic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
East have put things together for them with more
utter contempt of fitness? It is all in the
Turkish manner, you see.</p>

<p>There they sat, happier and happier, and
deeper and deeper in love every moment, on the
brown timber in the long grass, their hearts as full
of love as the meadow was of sunshine.</p>

<p>You have heard of the Sun's Golden Cup, in
which after sunset he was carried over Ocean's
stream, while we slumber in the night, to land
again in the East and give us the joy of his rising.
The great Golden Cup in which Hercules, too, was
taken over; it was as if that Cup had been filled to
the brim with the nectar of love and placed at the
lips to drink, inexhaustible.</p>

<p>In the play of Faust&mdash;Alere's <i>Faust</i>&mdash;Goethe
has put an interlude, an Intermezzo; I shall leave
Amaryllis and Amadis in their Interlude in Heaven.
Let the Play of Human Life, with its sorrows and its
Dread, pause awhile; let Care go aside behind the
wings, let Debt and Poverty unrobe, let Age
stand upright, let Time stop still (oh, Miracle! as
the Sun did in the Vale of Ajalon). Let us leave
our lovers in the Interlude in Heaven.</p>

<p>And as I must leave them (I trust but for a
little while) I will leave them on the brown oak
timber, sap-stain brown, in the sunshine and
dancing shadow of summer, among the long grass
and the wild flowers.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
